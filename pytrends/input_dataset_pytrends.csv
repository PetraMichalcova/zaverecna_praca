"Sugar comes in many forms and is found in a wide variety of foods. All forms of sugar are simple carbohydrates that our bodies use for energy. Although naturally occurring sugars in foods like fruit and dairy can be part of a healthy diet, too much added sugar can be harmful to health, especially for people with diabetes. 

According to the American Heart Association, healthy adults should aim for less than 36 grams of sugar per day for men and less than 25 grams per day for women.

Why You Should Eat Less Sugar
Added sugars contribute additional calories to food without also contributing nutrients. As a result, people trying to lose weight may want to avoid foods high in sugar. People with conditions that affect blood sugar control, like diabetes, should also avoid sugary foods. 

Sugar has an effect on many body systems, including:

Weight Management

Adding sugar to foods and beverages increases their caloric density without also increasing their nutritional value. Sweetening foods also makes them easier to overeat. This may make it difficult to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. 

Added sugars in the diet are associated with a higher risk of developing type II diabetes. For adults with diabetes, consuming too much sugar can also interfere with blood sugar control. 

Oral Health

All forms of sugar allow bacteria to multiply and grow, promoting tooth decay. Consuming foods and beverages with either natural or added sugars increases the chances that you will develop cavities, especially if you don't practice good oral hygiene. 

Foods With Sugar
Sugar comes in a variety of forms, from naturally occurring sugars to sweeteners like cane sugar and corn syrup. These eight foods are some of the most concentrated sources of sugar. 

1. Cane Sugar

Cane sugar is the most popular form of sugar found in packaged foods, baked goods, and some soft drinks. Cane sugar is derived from the sugar cane plant and contains sucrose, which is broken down into glucose and fructose in the body, thereby evoking an insulin response.

2. Honey

Honey is often considered a healthier alternative to cane sugar because it is harvesting naturally from bee hives and has some nutritional value. Fructose, which is sweeter than sucrose or glucose, is the main sugar found in honey. Although honey may have some health benefits, it should still be enjoyed in moderation. 

3. Agave

Some people have begun replacing cane sugar with agave syrup because it is purportedly lower on the glycemic index and therefore less likely to spike insulin. However, this has not been well supported by the research. Like honey, agave contains a higher percentage of fructose than cane sugar. 

4. Corn Syrup

Corn syrup, especially high-fructose corn syrup, has been implicated in the rise of obesity in the United States. This may be because the fructose in corn syrup doesn't signal satiety the way that an equal number of calories would when consumed in a different form.

5. Brown Rice Syrup

Brown rice syrup or malt syrup is derived by breaking down the starches in cooked rice. Very little research has been done on the health effects of brown rice syrup, but it is sometimes used as an alternative to corn syrup in baking and packaged foods. 

6. Dairy

Lactose is the naturally occurring form of sugar in dairy products. Many adults have a lactose intolerance, making dairy sugars difficult to digest. 

7. Fruit

All fruits contain some amount of naturally occurring sugars, or fructose. Some fruits, like bananas, are higher in sugar than others, like berries. Because the fructose in fruit is accompanied by fiber, it slows down your body's insulin response, making it a healthier alternative to added sugars.

8. Coconut Sugar

Coconut sugar, or palm sugar, is a sweetener derived from the sap of the palm tree. It has recently gained in popularity as a believed healthier alternative to cane sugar, although there is not enough research yet to support this claim. Like all sugars, coconut sugar should be used in moderation. 

Sugar-Free Alternatives
If you'd like to reduce your sugar intake, look for “no sugar added” on food packages. These products may still contain natural sugar in the foods used to make them, but they won't contain sugar added for taste. The following foods are great options for a low or no sugar diet:

1. Vegetables

Compared to fruits, most vegetables contain less sugar. The amount of sugar in different types of vegetables vary. Mushrooms, spinach, kale, soybean sprouts, celery, broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, radishes, and asparagus are among the vegetables with the lowest sugar content available.

2. Meat

Seafood, pork, beef, and chicken are all sugar-free. They're also an important source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

3. Beans, Nuts, Lentils

If you don't eat meat, soybeans, lentils, beans, nuts, and seeds are great sugar-free, high-protein foods.

4. Grains

Brown rice, quinoa, and oats are tasty, low-sugar foods that will help you meet your daily recommended fiber intake.";https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-sugar;reduce sugar

"Over the last few years, sugar's effect on our health has been well documented in a stream of damning research. The sweet stuff is now food enemy number one and is to blame for far more than hyperactive children and tooth decay.

With the World Health Organisation rewriting its recommendations for daily intake, you've possibly considered cutting back, but how do you kick the habit? Television presenter and fitness guru Davina McCall is keen to get the nation talking about sugar, and here she shares her personal tips for cutting back on sugar and her journey to becoming sugar-free.
We have plenty of guides to help you cut back on the sweet stuff. Check out 10 ways to manage sugar cravings, why is sugar bad for me? and will sugar make me old? Don't forget to browse our lower-sugar recipes for filling lunches, hearty dinners and sweet snacks that all contain less than 10g of sugar per serving.

Q. As of today, how long have you been sugar-free?
A. This time, I've been sugar-free for five months. I had given up sugar for a couple of years previously, but then when I did my Sport Relief challenge I started eating it again. I was doing an awful lot of exercise and had to eat a lot of sugar in the form of liquid gels and fast-releasing carbohydrates, such as rice and pasta, to keep my energy up. Really, for someone who is moderately active, carbs don't need to take up more than 10-20% of a meal, but my meals were about 70% carbs during that time.

Q. What was it that made you decide to give up sugar?
A. When my sister got cancer, the nutritionist told me that she should give up sugar and I found that quite telling. I did some research and realised I was a slave to it. We need a certain amount of carbohydrates, but we don't need added sugar. Stop eating it and you may stop mood swings, bad skin and weight gain.

Check out our helpful guide for all you need to know about sugar.

Q. Did sugar make you grumpy? (Facebook question from Rachael Scott)
A. Yeah, when I did it the first time cold turkey it made me very, very grumpy – I felt like I was grieving the loss of a loved one. I was more prepared this time round though, and have, for the most part, managed to taper off my sweet tooth.

Q. What does the term ‘sugar-free' mean to you?
A. Sugar-free to me means a diet free of refined sugar – things like processed foods and white flours, rice and bread. Packet sugar, too.

Q. Has quitting sugar changed the way you think about food?
A. I used to get stuck making the same 10 meals. There'd be a little variation, but I'd generally really struggle for inspiration – now I make all sorts of things!

Along the journey, I've also discovered some new ingredients that help balance my blood sugar levels and make my goal easier. Wholemeal spelt flour is one I couldn't be without – I used to think of it as being a faddy health food, but it's tasty, miles better for you than refined white flour and doesn't make you feel bloated. Also, spelt or barley make delicious alternatives to risotto rice.

Q. What health benefits did you notice after giving up sugar?
A. It definitely had an impact on my energy levels and my skin looks loads better. I also felt a sense of freedom and wasn't expecting that – I stopped feeling that I had to go to the fridge and scan for something sweet every evening. It took a while to get to that point, but was worth the wait.

Q. Your book is called 5 Weeks to Sugar-free – why five weeks?
A. I think it's a good amount of time – I don't know the science behind how long it takes for the craving to leave you, but I don't want people to be put off by going sugar-free too quickly. My book will slowly reduce the amount of refined sugars you eat. If you say to people 'you have to stop tomorrow', it's not realistic.

Q. What were the hardest times when you gave up sugar?
A. For me, 4pm was the worst time of day – I always used to have a lull about that time, especially when I worked in an office. Also about 9pm – after dinner I'd crave something sweet.

Q. How did you beat the cravings?
A. I'd have a piece of fruit and some plain nuts so I wasn't tempted to fall off the wagon. Just something to give me a sweet hit. As time goes by, those cravings don't happen anymore and it feels like being freed from the shackles of addiction.

Q. Do you think success is all in the preparation? (Facebook question from Ceri Morgan)
A. Definitely. You have to put strategies in place so when you're desperate and you would do anything for chocolate, you have something on hand.

Q. Do you avoid any fruits or natural sugars?
A. I do avoid grapes, but that's because they don't agree with me and give me a tummy ache. However, whole fruit is a great snack to have. I don't eat too many dried fruits as they're very sugary – I will have the odd raisin though.

Q. What alternatives do you use in baking? (Facebook question from Charlotte Davidson)
A. I just use maple syrup and honey in baking. These are classed as 'free' sugars so I do keep them to a minimum, but stevia is a useful option, too. I've replaced flour for wholemeal spelt in most of my bakes – you get the same results and it's a lovely taste.

Want to know more about stevia? Read our guide on this popular sugar substitute. Plus, we have a collection of delicious low-sugar baking recipes for you to try.

Q. What would be your ultimate tip for anyone thinking of going sugar-free?
A. The most important thing is not to beat yourself up if you slip – just pick it up again the next day. If you follow my plan, it should really help you; it's a good, balanced diet. Be realistic and make sure you have something sweet but free of refined sugars in the fridge in case you get a craving.

Q. Is there anyone you wouldn't recommend the lifestyle to?
A. Absolutely not – I think everyone can do it and it's a smart lifestyle choice. You have to want to do it for yourself though – I don't make my children go sugar-free because I think it's unrealistic for them. Reframe the idea: you're not giving up sugar, you're going to eat for better health. Affirm the fact you'll be giving yourself something rather than taking it away.

What Can You Eat?
Since there are several forms and types of sugar, it helps to know what you're looking for. If you see any of these on an ingredients list, the food has added sugars: 

Brown sugar
Corn sugar
Corn syrup
Fructose
Glucose
High fructose corn syrup
Honey (Though a naturally occurring sugar, honey is still considered an added sugar and it contains roughly the same amount of sugar as both high fructose corn syrup and granulated sugar)
Raw sugar
Sucrose
Sugar
Syrup
Turbinado sugar
Artificial sweeteners can offer an alternative to sugar since they contain little to no calories, but there's a lot of controversy surrounding sugar substitutes.3 Many health and nutrition experts have raised questions about whether artificial sweeteners are healthy and safe, and whether they are effective for weight loss. Some have also argued that sugar substitutes are so sweet they actually ramp up your taste buds for sweet foods and drinks.4 On the other hand, some proponents claim that artificial sweeteners can help people transition away from added sugars and cut them out for good.

While there is no one ""official"" no sugar diet, nutrition experts generally agree that the healthiest version of the eating plan cuts out added sugars by focusing on whole foods rather than simply replacing sugar with no-calorie sweeteners.

Look at the Nutrition Facts Label to determine how much added sugar is in each serving. It may be just a small amount, or it might be a lot. 

 56 Different Names for Sugar in Your Food
What You Need to Know
Following a no sugar diet does not mean you have to adhere to a formal eating plan, so there's no advice on meal or snack timing or even the makeup for your meals. You may find, however, that if you are just starting to cut out added sugar, it's best to do it gradually. If you're still facing sugar cravings, drink water and eat (non-sweetened, nutritious) food regularly, so you don't add extreme hunger to your sugar craving. Healthy fats are especially helpful for fighting sugar cravings.

To begin, try to limit your added sugar intake to 100 to 200 calories per day (a tablespoon of honey has about 60 calories and a tablespoon of sugar about 50). The 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines suggest that everyone should limit added sugar intake to 10% of daily calories or less (so, 200 if you're consuming about 2,000 calories a day).5

What to Eat
Foods with no added sugars

Foods that naturally contain sugar

Unsweetened beverages

What Not to Eat
Foods with added sugar

Sweetened beverages

Sugar products including honey and molasses

Be sure to read labels carefully and choose products that have the least or no added sugar. You don't have to give up sweet foods altogether, rather, you'll make healthier choices.

Foods With Natural Sugars

Whole foods that naturally contain sugar aren't off-limits on a balanced no sugar diet. For example, while whole fruits like oranges and pineapple and 100% fruit juices are naturally sweet, they don't have added sugar. (Some research shows that this is confusing to consumers, and understandably so.)6

The exceptions—and likely part of the reason behind the confusion—are products like fruit drinks that do contain added sugar. For example, most cranberry juice beverages are a combination of fruit juices (which naturally contain their own sugars), additional added sugar, and water.

While permitted on a no sugar diet, you may still need to watch the calorie count with the natural sugars like those found in fruit if one of your goals is weight loss. A large glass of fruit juice can have as many calories as the same size glass of sugary soft drink. But at least the juice also offers vitamins and minerals.

Unsweetened Beverages

Soda, lemonade, sweetened iced tea, and many sports and energy drinks contain added sugars and as a result, aren't permitted on a no sugar diet. Proponents of no sugar diets encourage drinking plain or carbonated water, unsweetened tea or coffee, and 100% fruit juice (in moderation).

Foods With Added Sugar

Pastries, cookies, candy bars, syrups, jams, jellies, and pre-sweetened breakfast cereals are all obvious sources of added sugars. But other foods such as salad dressings, sauces, condiments, flavored yogurts, instant oatmeal, fruit smoothies, and even gummy vitamins can also contain added sugars.

For cereal, look for brands that have less than 5 grams of sugar per serving, and choose the ones with the most fiber. Or make your own oatmeal or plain unsweetened cereal and add fruits and berries. Similarly, buy plain yogurt and add fresh fruit.

In general, choose whole foods whenever you can. Processed foods tend to have added sugar, salt, and/or fat. Similarly, simple carbohydrates (such as white flour, white rice, and pasta) don't contain added sugar, but they do break down into sugar quickly in the body. So opt for complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, more often.

Many low-carb diets also limit sugar, and a vegetarian or vegan diet can easily also be a no sugar diet. The best healthy cookbooks are full of low-sugar and no-sugar recipes to inspire you. As with any diet, if you have a health condition such as diabetes, consult with your doctor about the best eating plan for you.

Sample Shopping List
A no sugar diet emphasizes whole fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains, and eliminates foods containing added sugars. While what you eat on this plan is up to you, the following shopping list offers suggestions for getting started. Note that this is not a definitive shopping list and there may be other foods that you prefer.

Lean protein (chicken, cuts of beef, ground beef, salmon, halibut, shrimp)
Dark leafy greens (spinach, kale, Swiss chard, arugula)
Veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, eggplant, carrots)
Whole fruits (grapefruit, oranges, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)
Whole grains (quinoa, barley, amaranth, brown rice, couscous)
Legumes (black beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans)
Healthy fats (avocados, walnuts, almonds, cashews, chia seeds, flaxseeds, olive oil)
Dairy products (milk, feta cheese, parmesan, unsweetened yogurt, cottage cheese)
Eggs
Sample Meal Plan
What you eat on a no sugar diet can depend on whether you have a health condition or have specific weight loss goals. For instance, those on low-carb diets such as keto may avoid most fruits and many complex carbohydrates, which can still be included in other variations of a no sugar eating plan.

The following three-day meal plan is not all-inclusive but should give you a general sense of what a few days on a well-balanced low sugar diet could look like. Note that if you do choose to follow this diet, there may be other meals that work better for you.

Day 1

Breakfast: California summer vegetable omelet; 1 serving spinach and kale green juice; 1/2 cup blackberries
Lunch: 1 1/2 cups citrus, kale, and quinoa salad
Dinner: 4-ounce serving pan-seared salmon with Mediterranean quinoa; 1/2 cup roasted broccoli
Day 2

Breakfast: Spinach and feta oatmeal bowl; 1/2 grapefruit
Lunch: Tuna wrap; 1 cup red curry lentil soup with kale
Dinner: Quinoa stuffed chicken roll-up; 3 ounces spring mix greens with olive oil
Day 3

Breakfast: 1 cup breakfast quinoa topped with fresh mixed berries and almonds
Lunch: 3/4 cup avocado chicken salad; 1 cup rainbow vegetable soup
Dinner: 1 serving grilled Mediterranean shrimp and veggie skewers; 1 cup brown rice or couscous
Pros and Cons
Pros
Practicality

Simplicity

Flexibility

Sustainability

Cons
No formal guidelines or support

Can be challenging

Time-consuming

In addition to health and weight loss benefits, there are other great reasons to reduce the amount of added sugars in your diet. Review the pros and cons to help you decide whether a no sugar diet is right for you.

Pros
Practical and Realistic

Many diets, particularly those touting weight-loss claims, are not always realistic in practice. Some diets make bold claims of rapid weight loss in a short period of time. But more often than not, these plans end up backfiring and any weight loss experienced is likely to be regained once regular eating habits are resumed.

A no sugar diet focused on whole foods teaches healthy lifestyle habits since cutting out added sugar means you're also cutting out many packaged, processed foods containing artificial ingredients. It is a practical lifestyle to adhere to for not just weight loss but long-term weight management and overall health.

Simple to Follow

A no sugar diet does not have any timelines, guidelines, rules, or restrictions (aside from cutting out added sugars). There are no books to buy (unless you want to learn more) or products or supplements to subscribe to, nor is it promoted by a single celebrity or public figure. All you have to do is avoid added sugar by eating whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible, making this an easy-to-follow plan.

Flexible and Adaptable

Because there are no hard and fast rules on a no sugar diet, what you eat is up to your personal preferences and budget, and the plan is adaptable to suit your lifestyle. In addition, as you slowly wean yourself off sugar and your body starts to naturally crave more nutritious foods, a no sugar diet can encourage mindful, intuitive eating. In time, adhering to the no sugar lifestyle can become like second nature rather than a temporary fix or short-term diet.

Long-Term Sustainability

It's healthy and safe to eat this way indefinitely, and sugar cravings should fade over time. As long as you stick with whole foods and read labels carefully, you may find it easy to stick to this diet for the long term.

Following a no sugar diet (or even a low sugar diet) should offer health benefits including weight loss. But it can be difficult to fully cut added sugar from your diet.

Cons
No Guidelines to Follow

Since it's not a formal plan, a no sugar diet has few guidelines other than cutting out added sugars as completely as possible. There's no calorie or carb counting here, or even recommendations for portion control. While this can be a benefit to those seeking a less regimented eating plan to follow, some people may need more structure and parameters in order to meet their weight loss and health goals. For instance, without any calorie requirements to meet, it's still possible to overeat on this plan.

Challenging

Setting aside the common American taste for sugar, there is sugar hiding in many foods (some of them quite unexpected). Distinguishing added sugars from natural sugars can be difficult. As a rule of thumb, your best bet is to stick with real, whole foods and limit many packaged convenience foods. Always read labels carefully to look for added sugars.

Time-Consuming

While following a no-sugar lifestyle is undeniably healthy, keep in mind that you will have to do a lot more meal prep, planning, and cooking. For those who may not have that kind of time, a no sugar diet may not be the most realistic choice.

Is the No Sugar Diet a Healthy Choice for You?
Many low-carb eating plans also limit sugar, so those plans can resemble a no sugar diet in some ways. And cutting sugar also aligns with government advice on healthy eating. The USDA's dietary guidelines suggest a balanced mix of fruits, grains, vegetables, protein, and dairy products. There's no space for added sugars, but they're also not strictly prohibited.

If weight loss is one of your goals, you may need to count calories in addition to cutting back on added sugars. Avoiding those sugars will likely result in consuming fewer calories altogether, but to know for sure, use this tool to calculate a daily calorie goal, and then an app or journal to track your progress meeting that goal.
USDA guidelines suggest limiting your sugar intake to no more than 10% of your daily calories.5?? Once you get there, you can gradually reduce your consumption of added sugars even more.

Health Benefits
Many weight loss plans restrict sugar since it's an effective way to cut out empty (non-nutritious) calories. Doing that should help you lose weight. And whole, nutrient-dense foods tend to be more filling, so it's possible to eat less of them and still feel full.

A no sugar diet can also help people avoid other health risks that go along with high sugar intake. For example, one research review listed three studies that showed consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased blood pressure, inflammatory markers, total cholesterol, and visceral (belly) fat.7

Mounting evidence continues to show a number of positive health outcomes from cutting back on added sugars, including a reduction in the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.88

In addition, too much sugar can increase your risk of dental problems.9 So a no-sugar diet should help lower your risk of dental decay. 

Health Risks
While there are no common health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive eating plans can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. To that end, it's important to make sure you're still getting enough calories each day from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

A Word From Verywell
If you are looking to lose weight or simply improve your health, cutting added sugars could be a smart and fairly simple choice. For weight loss, you might also consider adding more fiber. But remember that weight loss is a complex process that should also include exercise, stress management, and other lifestyle factors. Discuss your plans with your physician to help create a plan that meets your needs.

Remember, following a long-term or short-term diet may not be necessary for you and many diets out there simply don’t work, especially long-term. While we do not endorse fad diet trends or unsustainable weight loss methods, we present the facts so you can make an informed decision that works best for your nutritional needs, genetic blueprint, budget, and goals.

If your goal is weight loss, remember that losing weight isn’t necessarily the same as being your healthiest self, and there are many other ways to pursue health. Exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle factors also play a major role in your overall health.

To begin, try to limit your added sugar intake to 100 to 200 calories per day (a tablespoon of honey has about 60 calories and a tablespoon of sugar about 50). The 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines suggest that everyone should limit added sugar intake to 10% of daily calories or less (so, 200 if you're consuming about 2,000 calories a day).5

What to Eat
Foods with no added sugars

Foods that naturally contain sugar

Unsweetened beverages

What Not to Eat
Foods with added sugar

Sweetened beverages

Sugar products including honey and molasses

Be sure to read labels carefully and choose products that have the least or no added sugar. You don't have to give up sweet foods altogether, rather, you'll make healthier choices.

Foods With Natural Sugars

Whole foods that naturally contain sugar aren't off-limits on a balanced no sugar diet. For example, while whole fruits like oranges and pineapple and 100% fruit juices are naturally sweet, they don't have added sugar. (Some research shows that this is confusing to consumers, and understandably so.)6

The exceptions—and likely part of the reason behind the confusion—are products like fruit drinks that do contain added sugar. For example, most cranberry juice beverages are a combination of fruit juices (which naturally contain their own sugars), additional added sugar, and water.

While permitted on a no sugar diet, you may still need to watch the calorie count with the natural sugars like those found in fruit if one of your goals is weight loss. A large glass of fruit juice can have as many calories as the same size glass of sugary soft drink. But at least the juice also offers vitamins and minerals.

Unsweetened Beverages

Soda, lemonade, sweetened iced tea, and many sports and energy drinks contain added sugars and as a result, aren't permitted on a no sugar diet. Proponents of no sugar diets encourage drinking plain or carbonated water, unsweetened tea or coffee, and 100% fruit juice (in moderation).

Foods With Added Sugar

Pastries, cookies, candy bars, syrups, jams, jellies, and pre-sweetened breakfast cereals are all obvious sources of added sugars. But other foods such as salad dressings, sauces, condiments, flavored yogurts, instant oatmeal, fruit smoothies, and even gummy vitamins can also contain added sugars.

For cereal, look for brands that have less than 5 grams of sugar per serving, and choose the ones with the most fiber. Or make your own oatmeal or plain unsweetened cereal and add fruits and berries. Similarly, buy plain yogurt and add fresh fruit.

In general, choose whole foods whenever you can. Processed foods tend to have added sugar, salt, and/or fat. Similarly, simple carbohydrates (such as white flour, white rice, and pasta) don't contain added sugar, but they do break down into sugar quickly in the body. So opt for complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, more often.

Many low-carb diets also limit sugar, and a vegetarian or vegan diet can easily also be a no sugar diet. The best healthy cookbooks are full of low-sugar and no-sugar recipes to inspire you. As with any diet, if you have a health condition such as diabetes, consult with your doctor about the best eating plan for you.

Sample Shopping List
A no sugar diet emphasizes whole fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains, and eliminates foods containing added sugars. While what you eat on this plan is up to you, the following shopping list offers suggestions for getting started. Note that this is not a definitive shopping list and there may be other foods that you prefer.

Lean protein (chicken, cuts of beef, ground beef, salmon, halibut, shrimp)
Dark leafy greens (spinach, kale, Swiss chard, arugula)
Veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, eggplant, carrots)
Whole fruits (grapefruit, oranges, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)
Whole grains (quinoa, barley, amaranth, brown rice, couscous)
Legumes (black beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans)
Healthy fats (avocados, walnuts, almonds, cashews, chia seeds, flaxseeds, olive oil)
Dairy products (milk, feta cheese, parmesan, unsweetened yogurt, cottage cheese)
Eggs
Sample Meal Plan
What you eat on a no sugar diet can depend on whether you have a health condition or have specific weight loss goals. For instance, those on low-carb diets such as keto may avoid most fruits and many complex carbohydrates, which can still be included in other variations of a no sugar eating plan.

The following three-day meal plan is not all-inclusive but should give you a general sense of what a few days on a well-balanced low sugar diet could look like. Note that if you do choose to follow this diet, there may be other meals that work better for you.

Day 1

Breakfast: California summer vegetable omelet; 1 serving spinach and kale green juice; 1/2 cup blackberries
Lunch: 1 1/2 cups citrus, kale, and quinoa salad
Dinner: 4-ounce serving pan-seared salmon with Mediterranean quinoa; 1/2 cup roasted broccoli
Day 2

Breakfast: Spinach and feta oatmeal bowl; 1/2 grapefruit
Lunch: Tuna wrap; 1 cup red curry lentil soup with kale
Dinner: Quinoa stuffed chicken roll-up; 3 ounces spring mix greens with olive oil
Day 3

Lunch: 3/4 cup avocado chicken salad; 1 cup rainbow vegetable soup
Dinner: 1 serving grilled Mediterranean shrimp and veggie skewers; 1 cup brown rice or couscous
Pros and Cons
Pros
Practicality

Simplicity

Flexibility

Sustainability

Cons
No formal guidelines or support

Can be challenging

Time-consuming

In addition to health and weight loss benefits, there are other great reasons to reduce the amount of added sugars in your diet. Review the pros and cons to help you decide whether a no sugar diet is right for you.

Pros
Practical and Realistic

Many diets, particularly those touting weight-loss claims, are not always realistic in practice. Some diets make bold claims of rapid weight loss in a short period of time. But more often than not, these plans end up backfiring and any weight loss experienced is likely to be regained once regular eating habits are resumed.

A no sugar diet focused on whole foods teaches healthy lifestyle habits since cutting out added sugar means you're also cutting out many packaged, processed foods containing artificial ingredients. It is a practical lifestyle to adhere to for not just weight loss but long-term weight management and overall health.

Simple to Follow

A no sugar diet does not have any timelines, guidelines, rules, or restrictions (aside from cutting out added sugars). There are no books to buy (unless you want to learn more) or products or supplements to subscribe to, nor is it promoted by a single celebrity or public figure. All you have to do is avoid added sugar by eating whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible, making this an easy-to-follow plan.

Flexible and Adaptable

Because there are no hard and fast rules on a no sugar diet, what you eat is up to your personal preferences and budget, and the plan is adaptable to suit your lifestyle. In addition, as you slowly wean yourself off sugar and your body starts to naturally crave more nutritious foods, a no sugar diet can encourage mindful, intuitive eating. In time, adhering to the no sugar lifestyle can become like second nature rather than a temporary fix or short-term diet.

Long-Term Sustainability

It's healthy and safe to eat this way indefinitely, and sugar cravings should fade over time. As long as you stick with whole foods and read labels carefully, you may find it easy to stick to this diet for the long term.

Following a no sugar diet (or even a low sugar diet) should offer health benefits including weight loss. But it can be difficult to fully cut added sugar from your diet.

Cons
No Guidelines to Follow

Since it's not a formal plan, a no sugar diet has few guidelines other than cutting out added sugars as completely as possible. There's no calorie or carb counting here, or even recommendations for portion control. While this can be a benefit to those seeking a less regimented eating plan to follow, some people may need more structure and parameters in order to meet their weight loss and health goals. For instance, without any calorie requirements to meet, it's still possible to overeat on this plan.

Challenging

Setting aside the common American taste for sugar, there is sugar hiding in many foods (some of them quite unexpected). Distinguishing added sugars from natural sugars can be difficult. As a rule of thumb, your best bet is to stick with real, whole foods and limit many packaged convenience foods. Always read labels carefully to look for added sugars.

Time-Consuming

While following a no-sugar lifestyle is undeniably healthy, keep in mind that you will have to do a lot more meal prep, planning, and cooking. For those who may not have that kind of time, a no sugar diet may not be the most realistic choice.

Is the No Sugar Diet a Healthy Choice for You?
Many low-carb eating plans also limit sugar, so those plans can resemble a no sugar diet in some ways. And cutting sugar also aligns with government advice on healthy eating. The USDA's dietary guidelines suggest a balanced mix of fruits, grains, vegetables, protein, and dairy products. There's no space for added sugars, but they're also not strictly prohibited.

If weight loss is one of your goals, you may need to count calories in addition to cutting back on added sugars. Avoiding those sugars will likely result in consuming fewer calories altogether, but to know for sure, use this tool to calculate a daily calorie goal, and then an app or journal to track your progress meeting that goal.
USDA guidelines suggest limiting your sugar intake to no more than 10% of your daily calories.5?? Once you get there, you can gradually reduce your consumption of added sugars even more.

Health Benefits
Many weight loss plans restrict sugar since it's an effective way to cut out empty (non-nutritious) calories. Doing that should help you lose weight. And whole, nutrient-dense foods tend to be more filling, so it's possible to eat less of them and still feel full.

A no sugar diet can also help people avoid other health risks that go along with high sugar intake. For example, one research review listed three studies that showed consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased blood pressure, inflammatory markers, total cholesterol, and visceral (belly) fat.7

Mounting evidence continues to show a number of positive health outcomes from cutting back on added sugars, including a reduction in the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.88

In addition, too much sugar can increase your risk of dental problems.9 So a no-sugar diet should help lower your risk of dental decay. 

Health Risks
While there are no common health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive eating plans can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. To that end, it's important to make sure you're still getting enough calories each day from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

A Word From Verywell
If you are looking to lose weight or simply improve your health, cutting added sugars could be a smart and fairly simple choice. For weight loss, you might also consider adding more fiber. But remember that weight loss is a complex process that should also include exercise, stress management, and other lifestyle factors. Discuss your plans with your physician to help create a plan that meets your needs.

Remember, following a long-term or short-term diet may not be necessary for you and many diets out there simply don’t work, especially long-term. While we do not endorse fad diet trends or unsustainable weight loss methods, we present the facts so you can make an informed decision that works best for your nutritional needs, genetic blueprint, budget, and goals.

If your goal is weight loss, remember that losing weight isn’t necessarily the same as being your healthiest self, and there are many other ways to pursue health. Exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle factors also play a major role in your overall health. The best diet is always the one that is balanced and fits your lifestyle.";https://www.verywellfit.com/what-is-a-no-sugar-diet-2507715;sugar diet
"If you want to make significant changes to your lifestyle for health reasons, reducing sugar intake is likely one of the first things that comes to mind. Sugar has been associated with numerous health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease, over the past few years. As a result, it is not surprising that the no-sugar diet-a diet that eliminates all added sugars and foods high in natural sugars-has recently gained popularity.

However, going sugar-free can be a difficult task, given that many scientists and experts denote sugar as one of the most addictive ingredients in the average modern diet.1 American adults consume an average of 60 pounds of added sugar a year2 -and that's because it's everywhere. ""Because there are over 50 different names given to sugars, it can make it even harder when reading food labels to determine what foods actually contain added sugar,"" explains nutritionist Emily Maguire.

While the primary (and most obvious) sources of sugar are sweetened beverages, desserts, foods containing high-fructose corn syrup, and sweets like candies, cookies, brownies, cakes, pies, and ice cream, these aren't the only culprits to look out for. Prepackaged salsa, canned soup, condiments, and bread, you name it-chances are, according to Maguire, they contain extra sugar, which means even the healthiest among us might not even be aware of how much sugar we consume daily.

To aid in your health journey, we asked Maguire, as well as licensed clinical psychologist and nutritionist Candice Seti, PsyD, and board-certified holistic health and nutrition practitioner Kimberly Spair, PhD-CCC-SLP/L, everything you need to know before attempting a low-sugar or no-sugar diet.

Candice Seti, PsyD, is a licensed clinical psychologist, nutritionist, and author based in San Diego, California.
Kimberly Spair, PhD-CCC-SLP/L, is a board-certified holistic health and nutrition practitioner.
Emily Maguire, MSc, BSc, is a UK-based nutritionist and the Strategy Director of Avalere Health. She specializes in the use of a low carbohydrate/ketogenic diet.
What Is a No-Sugar Diet?
The no-sugar diet is a diet that eliminates or limits all added sugars, foods high in natural sugars, and sugar substitutes. Stricter versions of the diet include eliminating foods with natural sugars, such as fruit, milk, and plain yogurt.

What Are The Benefits of a No-Sugar Diet?
There are numerous potential benefits of participating in a no-sugar or low-sugar diet, as excessive sugar consumption has been linked to the following:

Obesity
Diabetes
Heart disease
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Increased inflammation in the body
Adopting a no-sugar diet significantly decreases your risk for these health conditions.
What Can You Eat on a No-Sugar Diet?
Added sugar can be found in many products, but there are still plenty of options for food if you are looking to pursue a no-sugar diet. Some examples per Seti and Maguire include:

Chicken
Fish
Beef
Tofu
Eggs
Leafy greens
Nuts
Fruit
Dark Chocolate
Seeds
Olive oil
Avocado
Unsweetened yogurt
Carrots
Chickpeas
Beans
Quinoa
Sweet potatoes
Couscous
Sparkling water
Unsweetened beverages like coffee or tea
The beauty of this diet is that it has some allowances to keep you sane should cravings strike. While sugars and sweeteners of any kind-as well as refined grains and juices-may be limited or eliminated, you are permitted to have limited amounts of dark chocolate, fruit, whole grains, and even alcohol. For the best results, according to the experts, you'll want to moderate and indulge mindfully on those foods.

How to Follow a No-Sugar Diet
Plan and prepare
First things first: Clean out your pantry and fridge of any offending snacks or foods, because out of sight, out of mind(ish). Then your best strategy is to plan most of your meals. If you need some inspiration, there are so many websites and food blogs that specialize in recipes that are so tasty, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything-Minimalist Baker, Green Kitchen Stories, and Sprouted Kitchen are a few favorites.

""Look at the recipes and meal plans you want to follow, and get any ingredients you will need,"" advises Maguire. ""Remember the age-old saying, if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Look at your schedule for the coming week. Are you traveling a lot or have any dinners out? Plan by looking at the menu beforehand or have handy go-to sugar-free snacks. It'll make sticking with this all the easier.""

Once you hit the grocery store, the trickiest part is practicing a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to prepackaged or prepared foods. ""The hardest part of a sugar cleanse is avoiding all of the sneaky sugar hiding in even those most unsuspecting items, such as pasta sauce, dried fruit, juices, and yogurt,"" says Seti. ""Be sure to check the ingredient list on everything you buy.""

The first couple of days are the hardest
Because sugar is so addictive, you might even experience some withdrawal symptoms in addition to cravings. ""These symptoms usually occur in the first few days and can include headaches, stomach upset, irritability, and fatigue,"" says Seti. ""They will pass, so stick with it!""

Be ready for cravings and withdrawal symptoms
Maguire adds that in cases of extreme cravings, your best strategy is to allow your body to indulge-a healthy, non-restrictive way. ""The body is looking to satisfy the reward center in the brain,"" she explains. ""If you find that any craving hits, then reaching for good low-sugar snacks such as dark chocolate (above 70% cocoa), nut butter, nuts and seeds, or berries with Greek yogurt can kill the cravings.""

Byrdie Tip

Incorporate foods and beverages that are bitter into your diet to help reset your taste buds and fight cravings.3?

Drink lots of water
""A helpful tip while adjusting to a sugar cleanse is to drink a large amount of water throughout the day,"" says Seti. ""Water will help balance your blood sugar, keep your system running effectively, and minimize the impact of any withdrawal symptoms.""

Eat a lot of protein and fiber
""Many might experience sugar cravings as the brain seeks glucose,"" according to Spair. To keep your blood sugar balanced, protein is the category of food you want to focus on, with fiber coming in a close second. Those foods will curb your cravings and keep your energy up.4 Stock up on lean meats and fish, as well as nuts and seeds to munch on when cravings hit between meals. Broccoli is high in both, and so is edamame. Avocados are high in fiber and fat.5 The key is to know which foods you should load up on and which you should avoid. Knowing what you intend to eat beforehand will make things much easier when making decisions on the fly.

Avoid trying to ""replace"" your day-to-day foods
Don't expect that you'll be able to eat the sugar-free versions of things you like, or replace sugar-filled coffee with tea, and just go on like everything is the same. You're making a significant alteration-don't fight it.

Give yourself room to breathe
It's easy to press yourself, expecting that you'll be able to perform at the same level you were beforehand while you're detoxing. But you can follow all of the right steps to mitigate the side effects and still experience them.

Stress can actually cause you to crave sugary, easy-to-eat foods.6 Exercising will mitigate some stress, but you are going through a form of withdrawal and will likely feel cloudy.7 Try to avoid situations in which you need to perform at your peak at least for the first couple of days, and instead focus on taking care of yourself physically and mentally. This includes not being too hard on yourself if you break and have a piece of dark chocolate.

Mind over matter
""The most important thing when doing a sugar cleanse is to take it one day at a time,"" says Seti. ""Simply focus on getting through the day ahead of you before focusing on the next. Each day's success will build on the one before it. And if you struggle or don't succeed immediately, each day represents an opportunity to try again."" In other words, if you slip, don't sweat it. The fact that you're even trying is an accomplishment in itself.

And if you're ever waning on motivation, think back to your initial goals-even write them down so you have the constant reminder. ""Maybe you are looking to lose weight, improve your skin, or stop mood cycling,"" says Maguire. ""Whatever the reason, figuring out your goals will help you through this challenge. Anytime you feel like stopping or giving up, come back to why you started this in the first place, and it will give you the motivation to keep going or continue beyond your original timeline.""

Think of your goals
The best news is that after you get over the hump of those first tough couple of days, you'll be amazed by how energized and how great you feel-your mood will start to regulate, you'll sleep better,8? and you might even see some improvements in your skin and body. Be mindful and observant of the good, because it will power you right through the end (and perhaps beyond).

Try and keep with it
After any detox, the worst thing you can do for your body is overload on the thing you were detoxing from the second you're ""allowed"" to. Instead, celebrate with some dark chocolate, bread and cheese, or a little wine-something sugary that isn't a piece of cake. Slowly integrate sugar back into your diet (if you want to at all); it'll be a shock your system if you eat too much so soon. Plus, you might not have as much of a taste for sugar anyway.

Potentials Risks
While there are no known health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive diets can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. It's important to ensure you're still getting enough calories daily from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

There are numerous potential benefits of participating in a no-sugar or low-sugar diet, as excessive sugar consumption has been linked to the following:

Obesity
Diabetes
Heart disease
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Increased inflammation in the body
Adopting a no-sugar diet significantly decreases your risk for these health conditions.
What Can You Eat on a No-Sugar Diet?
Added sugar can be found in many products, but there are still plenty of options for food if you are looking to pursue a no-sugar diet. Some examples per Seti and Maguire include:

Chicken
Fish
Beef
Tofu
Eggs
Leafy greens
Nuts
Fruit
Dark Chocolate
Seeds
Olive oil
Avocado
Unsweetened yogurt
Carrots
Chickpeas
Beans
Quinoa
Sweet potatoes
Couscous
Sparkling water
Unsweetened beverages like coffee or tea
The beauty of this diet is that it has some allowances to keep you sane should cravings strike. While sugars and sweeteners of any kind-as well as refined grains and juices-may be limited or eliminated, you are permitted to have limited amounts of dark chocolate, fruit, whole grains, and even alcohol. For the best results, according to the experts, you'll want to moderate and indulge mindfully on those foods.

How to Follow a No-Sugar Diet
Plan and prepare
First things first: Clean out your pantry and fridge of any offending snacks or foods, because out of sight, out of mind(ish). Then your best strategy is to plan most of your meals. If you need some inspiration, there are so many websites and food blogs that specialize in recipes that are so tasty, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything-Minimalist Baker, Green Kitchen Stories, and Sprouted Kitchen are a few favorites.

""Look at the recipes and meal plans you want to follow, and get any ingredients you will need,"" advises Maguire. ""Remember the age-old saying, if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Look at your schedule for the coming week. Are you traveling a lot or have any dinners out? Plan by looking at the menu beforehand or have handy go-to sugar-free snacks. It'll make sticking with this all the easier.""

Once you hit the grocery store, the trickiest part is practicing a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to prepackaged or prepared foods. ""The hardest part of a sugar cleanse is avoiding all of the sneaky sugar hiding in even those most unsuspecting items, such as pasta sauce, dried fruit, juices, and yogurt,"" says Seti. ""Be sure to check the ingredient list on everything you buy.""

The first couple of days are the hardest
Because sugar is so addictive, you might even experience some withdrawal symptoms in addition to cravings. ""These symptoms usually occur in the first few days and can include headaches, stomach upset, irritability, and fatigue,"" says Seti. ""They will pass, so stick with it!""

Be ready for cravings and withdrawal symptoms
Maguire adds that in cases of extreme cravings, your best strategy is to allow your body to indulge-a healthy, non-restrictive way. ""The body is looking to satisfy the reward center in the brain,"" she explains. ""If you find that any craving hits, then reaching for good low-sugar snacks such as dark chocolate (above 70% cocoa), nut butter, nuts and seeds, or berries with Greek yogurt can kill the cravings.""

Byrdie Tip

Incorporate foods and beverages that are bitter into your diet to help reset your taste buds and fight cravings.3?

Drink lots of water
""A helpful tip while adjusting to a sugar cleanse is to drink a large amount of water throughout the day,"" says Seti. ""Water will help balance your blood sugar, keep your system running effectively, and minimize the impact of any withdrawal symptoms.""

Eat a lot of protein and fiber
""Many might experience sugar cravings as the brain seeks glucose,"" according to Spair. To keep your blood sugar balanced, protein is the category of food you want to focus on, with fiber coming in a close second. Those foods will curb your cravings and keep your energy up.4 Stock up on lean meats and fish, as well as nuts and seeds to munch on when cravings hit between meals. Broccoli is high in both, and so is edamame. Avocados are high in fiber and fat.5 The key is to know which foods you should load up on and which you should avoid. Knowing what you intend to eat beforehand will make things much easier when making decisions on the fly.

Avoid trying to ""replace"" your day-to-day foods
Don't expect that you'll be able to eat the sugar-free versions of things you like, or replace sugar-filled coffee with tea, and just go on like everything is the same. You're making a significant alteration-don't fight it.

Give yourself room to breathe
It's easy to press yourself, expecting that you'll be able to perform at the same level you were beforehand while you're detoxing. But you can follow all of the right steps to mitigate the side effects and still experience them.

Stress can actually cause you to crave sugary, easy-to-eat foods.6 Exercising will mitigate some stress, but you are going through a form of withdrawal and will likely feel cloudy.7 Try to avoid situations in which you need to perform at your peak at least for the first couple of days, and instead focus on taking care of yourself physically and mentally. This includes not being too hard on yourself if you break and have a piece of dark chocolate.

Mind over matter
""The most important thing when doing a sugar cleanse is to take it one day at a time,"" says Seti. ""Simply focus on getting through the day ahead of you before focusing on the next. Each day's success will build on the one before it. And if you struggle or don't succeed immediately, each day represents an opportunity to try again."" In other words, if you slip, don't sweat it. The fact that you're even trying is an accomplishment in itself.

And if you're ever waning on motivation, think back to your initial goals-even write them down so you have the constant reminder. ""Maybe you are looking to lose weight, improve your skin, or stop mood cycling,"" says Maguire. ""Whatever the reason, figuring out your goals will help you through this challenge. Anytime you feel like stopping or giving up, come back to why you started this in the first place, and it will give you the motivation to keep going or continue beyond your original timeline.""

Think of your goals
The best news is that after you get over the hump of those first tough couple of days, you'll be amazed by how energized and how great you feel-your mood will start to regulate, you'll sleep better,8? and you might even see some improvements in your skin and body. Be mindful and observant of the good, because it will power you right through the end (and perhaps beyond).

Try and keep with it
After any detox, the worst thing you can do for your body is overload on the thing you were detoxing from the second you're ""allowed"" to. Instead, celebrate with some dark chocolate, bread and cheese, or a little wine-something sugary that isn't a piece of cake. Slowly integrate sugar back into your diet (if you want to at all); it'll be a shock your system if you eat too much so soon. Plus, you might not have as much of a taste for sugar anyway.

Potentials Risks
While there are no known health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive diets can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. It's important to ensure you're still getting enough calories daily from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Before changing your diet, consult with a licensed physician to determine if a plan is right for you.";https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-give-up-sugar;sugar intake
"The sugar-free plan is one of the most famous, and most followed, eating plans out there - but what exactly is it?

Experts around the world have been warning about the dangers of excess sugar for generations - and for good reason. Many of us underestimate our sugar consumption and our children's sugar intake, too. Yet too much of the sweet stuff, in most of its forms, can have a seriously negative impact on the body.

So whether you're looking to sustainably cut sugar out of your diet completely or just look for easy ways to reduce your sugar intake, without having to detox, our expert-approved plan can help.

What is the sugar-free plan?
The sugar-free plan is a week-long plan that involves following the golden rules of the sugar-free diet for days 1-3. On days 4-7, you add a healthy dessert in the evening, such as fruit salad, yogurt or fromage frais with stewed fruit.

The golden rules of the sugar-free diet plan:

No desserts, no fruit and no sugar in drinks 
No juices, squashes or diet colas
Drink tea, coffee (no sugar or sweeteners) milk, plain water
No ketchup, brown sauce, Thai or Chinese-type sweet and sour sauces
Base your meals around meat, fish and eggs
A carbohydrate breakfast of unsweetened cereal is allowed.
Why is eating sugar bad for you?
Sugar leads to increased inflammation in the body and the potential onset of serious diseases. Dee Momi, nutritionist & founder of MINT Wellbeing, says this can manifest in all sorts of ways. 

She explains: ""From the most obviously visible - weight gain (particularly around the belly area), a higher risk of developing acne and fluctuating moods - to the more critical, including increasing your risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.""

Sugar also has the potential to disrupt an area of the brain, nutrition researcher from Brain Freed Ltd, Dishalni Senthilkumaran, says. ""Excess sugar can have an inflammatory effect on the brain’s memory centre and can be an increased risk factor in cognitive decline, whilst a 2017 study at UCL also sugar increases the likelihood of anxiety and depression."" It can also deplete essential nutrients in our body, including magnesium.

We know that sugar can cause a positive 'rush' over a short period of time. And while this is typically associated with hyperactivity in children, sugar actually triggers pleasure responses in adults too. ""Sugar triggers your reward and pleasure chemical dopamine, which is released when you derive pleasure from great food, sex and a sense of accomplishment. Excess dopamine can reduce novelty and prompt impulsive behaviour.""

Coming down from a sugar rush as your blood sugar levels return to normal can leave you feeling fatigued, thirsty, with headaches and frequent need to urinate.

Along with the long-term risks of disease and the mental impacts, sugar is famously bad for your dental hygiene. The NHS say that sugary food and drinks are in fact one of the main causes of tooth decay, as ""acid is produced when the bacteria in your mouth break down the sugar. The acid dissolves the tooth surface, which is the first stage of tooth decay.""

So with sugar proven to affect your weight, long-term health risks, mental health and dental hygiene, how can you cut back? This is the plan to follow.

How having a sugar free diet can help you lose weight
To lose weight, you have to be in a calorie deficit. Consuming lots of sugary foods - such as processed and mass-produced foods including juices, cooking sauces and condiments - that contain fructose can make this process harder, since these foods also tend to be high in calories. 

""When consumed, this type of sugar increases your hunger leading to a craving for more food."" Nutritionist Dee says, ""The hormone leptin helps the body to regulate hunger and alerts you when to stop eating - but consuming fructose in excess confuses this natural process.""

That being said, health and lifestyle coach Ryan Hodgson warns that we need to stop demonising sugar and seeing it as the enemy. Instead, he says, ""We need to become aware that actually often nutritional related health problems stem from overconsumption of calories as opposed to too much of one specific nutrient.

""It happens to to be that those who over consume on calories often eat a high carbohydrate (sugar) diet because carbs aren’t as satisfying as the other macronutrients (proteins and fats). Correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, particularly in the instance of more sugar in the diet and poor health. It’s more the overall eating habits.

""For those who perhaps to find themselves wanting to go for higher sugar foods, I’d suggest looking at meals and snacks and asking the questions: What protein source am I getting here (protein will help reduce sugar cravings and keep you fuller)? Am I hydrated enough? Am I really craving sugar or do I just need to eat a well balanced meal? It’s also important to be aware of how sugar can impact the body and abstaining from it. I’ve seen many people try cut sugar out and not felt great from it, it can affect you hormonally, mentally and physically too. Remember sugar isn’t the enemy, but also the body doesn’t ‘need’ carbs (or sugar), it needs protein (essential amino acids), it needs fats (essential fatty acids), but it doesn’t need carbs. We just often feel and perform better when we include them in our diet.”

To make a change, nutritionist Dee suggests starting small. ""The single easiest way to curb sugar in your diet is to remove or excessively reduce the amount of sugary drinks you may be consuming as they are loaded with fructose and offer very little to no nutritional value. If it's too big a step to cut them out completely, wean yourself off them gradually and replace every 2nd or 3rd drink with fruit infused sparkling water, or a cordial with a lower sugar content.""

You can also reduce dependency on sugary pre-made sauces and flavourings by replacing it with more wholefoods-based products. ""Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and curry leaves actually help lower and regulate blood sugar levels so you don't experience the highs and dips that follow processed sugar consumption."" Dee says, ""Adding a little natural fat such as olive oil, coconut milk or avocado satiates the body, leaving us comfortably satisfied.""";https://www.goodto.com/wellbeing/sugar-free-diet-83093;sugar diet

"The idea
The most extreme form of a sugar-free diet restricts all foods that contain added sugars as well as fruit and any vegetables that contain natural sugars such as peas, carrots and parsnips. The less extreme form of the diet permits fruit (but not juices) and vegetables and restricts all added sugars, honey and processed foods that contain sugars such as sugar-sweetened drinks, confectionery, sweet snacks, biscuits, cakes, pastries, ice cream and desserts, sweetened yoghurt, most breakfast cereals, sauces, soups and marinades.
 
Some sugar-free diets claim that sugar is addictive and must be totally eliminated to ‘cure’ the addiction.

The science
All sugars and starches contribute 17 kilojoules/gram. Proteins have the same level of kilojoules – 17/g. Alcohol has more – 29kJ/g and fats contribute the most with 37 kJ/g.

A sugar-free diet will cut kilojoules from sugar itself and also because many foods with added sugar contain starches and fat (for example confectionery, biscuits, cakes, ice cream and desserts). When the diet is effective, it is because total kilojoules fall.


Sugar has no essential nutrients and simply contributes kilojoules. Australia’s Dietary Guidelines have always recommended we limit sugar and research continues to support the need for such a guideline.

Sugar needs to be limited. It adds unnecessary kilojoules, and like refined starches, it increases dental decay. However, there is no evidence that a totally sugar-free diet is needed. The World Health Organization advises limiting added sugars to less than 10% of total energy to prevent dental caries, obesity, and chronic disease. The American Heart Association recommends that added sugars should be limited to less than 5% of total energy intake as a strategy for preventing excess weight (which is a risk factor for heart disease).

There is no scientific support for avoiding fruits and vegetables because of their natural sugar content. These foods also provide dietary fibre (which is nature’s obstacle to overconsumption) as well as minerals and vitamins. Research also shows that consumption of fruit and vegetables helps control weight.

Research shows that fructose is problematic only in excess, and the basic problem in most cases is simply the extra kilojoules from a high intake of fructose. Research also shows that anyone who exercises regularly and pre-menopausal women, will be unlikely to have problems with fructose.

Sugar does not fulfil any official definition of ‘addictive’, although once our taste buds become used to sweetness, some people will overindulge in sweet foods.

How to cut down on sugar
Avoid foods that do not contain any necessary nutrients – for example, soft drinks and confectionery, biscuits and pastries.
Limit cakes and sugary desserts.
Read the ingredient list on breakfast cereals. Best sugar-free choices include oats or a quality muesli (check the ingredient list rather than the total sugars as this will include naturally occurring sugars in dried fruit), or any wholegrain product with less than 3% total sugars.
Read the ingredient list on products such as marinades and sauces. If sugar occurs as one of the first three ingredients, look for a healthier choice or make your own ‘from scratch’ using wine, different flavoured vinegars (for example cider or balsamic) plus extra virgin olive oil, any herbs or spices or garlic or onion.
Choose natural yoghurt and add your own fruit.
Watch out
Sensible eating involves long-term commitment so it’s usually best to avoid going to extremes as this can lead to feelings of deprivation. For example, it makes more sense to ask for a small serving of birthday cake or to share a small dessert with a friend rather than avoid all treats and then break out and binge.";https://www.taste.com.au/healthy/articles/the-sugar-free-diet/yc4b9bvp;contain sugars

The American Heart Association recommends that added sugars should be limited to less than 5% of total energy intake as a strategy for preventing excess weight (which is a risk factor for heart disease).

There is no scientific support for avoiding fruits and vegetables because of their natural sugar content. These foods also provide dietary fibre (which is nature’s obstacle to overconsumption) as well as minerals and vitamins. Research also shows that consumption of fruit and vegetables helps control weight.

Research shows that fructose is problematic only in excess, and the basic problem in most cases is simply the extra kilojoules from a high intake of fructose. Research also shows that anyone who exercises regularly and pre-menopausal women, will be unlikely to have problems with fructose.

Sugar does not fulfil any official definition of ‘addictive’, although once our taste buds become used to sweetness, some people will overindulge in sweet foods.

How to cut down on sugar
Avoid foods that do not contain any necessary nutrients – for example, soft drinks and confectionery, biscuits and pastries.
Limit cakes and sugary desserts.
Read the ingredient list on breakfast cereals. Best sugar-free choices include oats or a quality muesli (check the ingredient list rather than the total sugars as this will include naturally occurring sugars in dried fruit), or any wholegrain product with less than 3% total sugars.
Read the ingredient list on products such as marinades and sauces. If sugar occurs as one of the first three ingredients, look for a healthier choice or make your own ‘from scratch’ using wine, different flavoured vinegars (for example cider or balsamic) plus extra virgin olive oil, any herbs or spices or garlic or onion.
Choose natural yoghurt and add your own fruit.
Watch out
Sensible eating involves long-term commitment so it’s usually best to avoid going to extremes as this can lead to feelings of deprivation. For example, it makes more sense to ask for a small serving of birthday cake or to share a small dessert with a friend rather than avoid all treats and then break out and binge.";https://www.taste.com.au/healthy/articles/the-sugar-free-diet/yc4b9bvp;limit sugar
