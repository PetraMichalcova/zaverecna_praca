"If you're in the market for nutritional info, Ohio State dietitian Candice Schreiber is here to help, serving up details about the sometimes complicated relationship between food and cancer.

On today's menu: how whole grains impact cancer prevention.

The health benefits of grains
Grains are the seeds and energy stores of a wide variety of cultivated grasses, including wheat, rice, farro, oats, quinoa and barley. Whole grains are made from the entire seed - the bran, germ and endosperm - and they contain a wealth of fiber, phytochemicals, B vitamins and protein.

""Research shows that fiber can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, and this may be because undigested carbohydrates in grains help move food through the body, reducing the transit time,"" Schreiber says, adding that research from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) found that a six-ounce serving of whole grains every day reduces the risk of colorectal cancer by 21 percent.

Studies also indicate that eating a daily dose of whole grains could reduce other types of cancer, including breast and liver types. A diet full of grains can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, and can improve digestive health. Whole grains are often inexpensive and can reduce the reliance many people have on animal-based proteins.

""Whole grains are healthy and versatile, plus they taste great - very nutty and satisfying,"" Schreiber says.

Go whole
It's important to consume whole grains, as processing and refinement remove the germ and outer layers, which in turn reduces the amount of healthy fiber and nutrients.

""Always look at the ingredients of bread and cereal and other grain products, and make sure the first ingredient is whole grain - as in whole grain wheat or whole grain oats"" Schreiber advises. ""Be careful about getting highly-processed foods that say they have added fiber - adding fiber to something highly processed with a lot of sugar in it doesn't make it healthy.""

Be careful, Schreiber warns, as many terms found on ingredient lists can confuse consumers into thinking they're getting whole grains, including:

multigrain
seven grain
cracked wheat
stone-ground
100-percent wheat
enriched flour
made with whole grains
Easy additions
""One of the easiest ways to add more whole grains to your diet is to replace white rice with brown,"" Schreiber says. ""Avoid white bread and choose whole grain versions, and use whole grain pasta.""

You can also increase your intake by cooking and baking with whole grain flour instead of all-purpose flour and making sure your cereal is made from whole grains and is not enriched.

Ancient grains, such as farro, wheat berries, amaranth and freekeh, are becoming more and more popular and easier to find in stores, and barley, quinoa and whole wheat couscous are also finding their way into more and more recipes and restaurant options. ""You can add one or more of these grains to salads, soups, casseroles and stews,"" Schreiber says.

Grain bowls
One of the easiest, healthiest and tastiest ways to add more great grains to your diet are grain bowls, which have become quite popular at restaurants in recent years. ""I make them at home all the time,"" Schreiber says, adding that she makes a large pot of grain, enough for several meals, and then gets creative.

""For example, for lunch I'll take some farro, chick peas and veggies and add some healthy salad dressing - and the kids love it,"" she says, adding that they also love her Mexican grain bowl of brown rice, black beans, salsa and avocado. Roasted veggies, such as beets, carrots, sweet potatoes and different types of squash go great in a grain bowl and so does fruit. Add some blueberries, strawberries, toasted walnuts, spinach and a little feta to some quinoa and farro, and your guests will be asking for second helpings.

""Another one of my favorites is a mango, arugula and wheat berry salad/grain bowl with cilantro lime dressing,"" Schreiber says.

"How many carbohydrates should you eat for ideal health with type 1 diabetes? It's a question that evades an easy answer. With diabetes nutrition, as with most things, one size doesn't fit all, according to two new studies.

At the ""Are We What We Eat?"" symposium at the EASD 2023 conference in Hamburg, Germany, two nutrition researchers presented new data that attempted to, if not answer the question of what the ideal diet should be for those with type 1 diabetes, at least suggest ways to expand the conversation to make it more inclusive.

Dr. Hana Kahleova, director of clinical research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington D.C., presented findings of a study of a plant-based diet versus a standard portion-controlled diet for those with type 1 diabetes. Since insulin dependence is linked to a decreased life span, she said her aim was to find a way to lower the amount of insulin needed for people with type 1 diabetes through nutrition.

Kahleova cited the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) that documented over 30 years that higher insulin doses in people with type 1 diabetes were associated with a higher body mass index, higher pulse rate, and impaired blood lipids. The consequences have been devastating, she noted, as each increase of 0.1 units/kg/day of insulin dose was associated with a 6% increase in cardiovascular disease.

""Is there anything we can do to address this with nutrition?"" Kahleova asked. ""Can we actually lower the insulin dose with nutrition?""

The current recommendations for type 1 diabetes are portion control, carbohydrate counting, and minimizing the consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, with the bolus insulin dose calculated based on the carbohydrate content of the meal. Kahleova said thousands of patients reported that different meals with similar carb levels affected them differently, leading to a great deal of confusion and frustration.

""We know that all carbohydrates are not created equal,"" she said. ""There's also a lot of variability in terms of fat and protein content and fiber content. The fiber content of the meals seems to be one of the most crucial aspects for people with type 1 diabetes.""

The average American consumes 16 grams of fiber a day, only half the recommended daily amount. The average in Europe is a bit higher with about 20 grams a day, but still not close to enough. Another study has shown that 30-35 grams of fiber a day was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality by about 15% compared with low-fiber intake.
""Fiber in diabetes has a much more important role to people than for the general population,"" Kahleova said, adding that for those with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, the all-cause mortality from fiber deficiency might be as much as 45%, and 39% for cardiovascular disease.

""We know that a plant-based diet has been shown to be beneficial in type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity as well as improving beta cell function in overweight people with no diabetes,"" she said, adding she was curious if the same benefits were possible for those with type 1.

Kahleova said this small study, consisting of 58 people with type 1 diabetes, was the first plant-based diet trial looking at insulin resistance for people with type 1 diabetes, adding that more work now needs to be done to follow up on the encouraging results.

The study found:

Energy intake did not change significantly in either group from the start to the end of the trial period. In the vegan group, the carbohydrate intake increased from about 200 g to 300 g a day, while the fat content went down to keep the calories consistent. In the portion-controlled group, the macronutrient ratio stayed steady.
Total daily insulin dose did not change in the portion-control group, but it did decrease significantly, by 12.1 units a day, or a 28% drop, in the vegan group.
Insulin sensitivity did not change significantly in the portion-control group, but it increased in the vegan group by 144%.
A1C deceased in both groups. It decreased by 0.6% in the portion-control group and by 0.8% in the vegan group.
Body weight didn't change in the portion-control group, but it did decrease by 11.5 pounds on the vegan diet.
Total cholesterol dropped significantly on both diets, but it decreased more on the vegan diet. LDL cholesterol levels were reduced only on the vegan diet.
Kidney function improved on the vegan diet over the portion-control diet.
""This is a novel approach for people with type 1 diabetes,"" she told diaTribe about the study. ""At first, it may seem intimidating to eat so many carbohydrates, but the most important aspect is that when people want to try this diet, they need to keep the fat content low. You need to pick which will be your main fuel.""

Sofia Sterner Isaksson, of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, presented a different study looking at varying carbohydrate ratios in diets for type 1 diabetes to evaluate the effects of carbohydrate intake on glucose control. Her team compared a moderate-level carbohydrate diet (in which 30% of the day's energy came from carbohydrates) with a traditional diet (in which half of the day's calories came from carbohydrates).

The small study, looking at 50 people with type 1 diabetes, found that those on the moderate carbohydrate diet had better glucose control. The group on the moderate carbohydrate diet also had a better average time in range, by 5%, and less time above range, by 6.4%. Also notable, she said, was a reported higher treatment satisfaction rate for the moderate group. There was no increased risk for hypoglycemia, dyslipidemia, ketoacidosis or elevated blood pressure between the two diet groups.

""These results indicate that a moderate carbohydrate diet can be an effective and safe diet option for some people with type 1 diabetes,"" Sterner Isaksson said. ""Both diets were individualized by a dietitian and were healthy, and this was important so as not to negatively impact other health markers like weight, blood pressure or lipids.""

Reflecting on the data presented earlier by Kahleova, Sterner Isaksson told diaTribe after the panel discussion that it was clear that there was more than one way for people with type 1 diabetes to eat in ways that supported their health and diets should be individualized.

""It's important to have different types of diets that fit with different individuals,"" she said. ""Lowering the amount of carbohydrates could fit for some people, but a plant-based diet with higher carbohydrate content with a lot of fibers could work better for others. That is why it's so nice to see new studies investigating diets in type 1 diabetes.""";https://diatribe.org/type-1-diabetes-new-studies-vegan-and-moderate-carbohydrate-diets-type-1-diabetes;many carbohydrates eat ideal health type 1 diabetes ?

"Healthy Diet
Fish is a low-fat high quality protein. Fish is filled with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins such as D and B2 (riboflavin). Fish is rich in calcium and phosphorus and a great source of minerals, such as iron, zinc, iodine, magnesium, and potassium. The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least two times per week as part of a healthy diet. Fish is packed with protein, vitamins, and nutrients that can lower blood pressure and help reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Healthy Fish Recipes
Learn how to properly cook fish and try some healthy recipes.
Healthy Fish Guide
Choose seafood that's low in contaminants and high in health benefits.
Healthy Heart and Brain
Eating fish is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids. These essential nutrients keep our heart and brain healthy. Two omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Our bodies don't produce omega-3 fatty acids so we must get them through the food we eat. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in every kind of fish, but are especially high in fatty fish. Some good choices are salmon, trout, sardines, herring, canned mackerel, canned light tuna, and oysters.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids:
Help maintain a healthy heart by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of sudden death, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythms, and strokes.
Aid healthy brain function and infant development of vision and nerves during pregnancy.
May decrease the risk of depression, ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and diabetes.
May prevent inflammation and reduce the risk of arthritis.
Cultural Importance
Fish is an important cultural icon in Washington State that defines a recreational as well as a spiritual way of life in the Pacific Northwest. Fish is not only an important source of nutrition, the act of catching, preparing, and eating fish are important cultural and family practices as well. To Native American Indian Tribes of Washington, fish, especially salmon, are an integral part of their lives, and serve as a symbol of their prosperity, culture, and heritage.";https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/food/fish/health-benefits;healthy diet fish low-fat high quality protein . fish filled omega-3 fatty acids vitamins b2 ( riboflavin ) . fish rich calcium phosphorus great source minerals , iron , zinc , iodine , magnesium , potassium . american heart association recommends eating fish least two times per week part healthy diet . fish packed protein , vitamins , nutrients lower blood pressure help reduce risk heart attack stroke . healthy fish recipes learn properly cook fish try healthy recipes . healthy fish guide choose seafood 's low contaminants high health benefits . healthy heart brain eating fish important source omega-3 fatty acids . essential nutrients keep heart brain healthy . two omega-3 fatty acids found fish epa ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) dha ( docosahexaenoic acid ) . bodies n't produce omega-3 fatty acids must get food eat . omega-3 fatty acids found every kind fish , especially high fatty fish . good choices salmon , trout , sardines , herring , canned mackerel , canned light tuna , oysters . omega-3 fatty acids : help maintain healthy heart lowering blood pressure reducing risk sudden death , heart attack , abnormal heart rhythms , strokes . aid healthy brain function infant development vision nerves pregnancy . may decrease risk depression , adhd , alzheimer 's disease , dementia , diabetes . may prevent inflammation reduce risk arthritis . cultural importance fish important cultural icon washington state defines recreational well spiritual way life pacific northwest . fish important source nutrition , act catching , preparing , eating fish important cultural family practices well . native american indian tribes washington , fish , especially salmon , integral part lives , serve symbol prosperity , culture , heritage .
"Cottage cheese doesn't typically receive a lot of attention. It gets left out from the fancy cheese counter at the grocery store. It doesn't make the cut for a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board. And it isn't typically included in recipes for favorite foods such as pizza, grilled cheese or baked ziti.

It's a soft, white, fresh cheese that's different in texture and taste than more popular cheddar, Parmesan and blue cheeses. But cottage cheese holds a prominent place in the dairy aisle for good reasons, says registered dietitian Julia Zumpano, RD, LD.

""It's a portable food that's easy to add to your diet,"" she says. ""And cottage cheese offers lots of health benefits.""

As a dairy product, cottage cheese is a great calcium source, which is important for bone health. Having healthier bones makes you less likely to get osteoporosis (weak bones). Cottage cheese in your diet can even help with your blood sugar levels.

Thinking about giving cottage cheese a go? Zumpano explains what you need to know.

Is cottage cheese healthy?
Cottage cheese is low in calories while providing protein and vital nutrients, Zumpano says, making it one of the healthiest cheeses you can eat. It's made by curdling pasteurized (sterilized) cow's milk - when milk turns acidic, the milk protein separates and forms curds (clumps). These loose curds serve as the base for cottage cheese.

Depending on the fat content of curdled dairy milk, cottage cheese is available as nonfat, low fat (1% or 2%) or whole fat. The milk type affects the nutritional content.

""To get the most bang for your buck, choose a low-fat or even full-fat cottage cheese,"" Zumpano advises. ""Nonfat cottage cheese may sound like a good idea, but it contains less protein and won't be as satisfying."" Full-fat cottage has 1.5 grams more of saturated fat when compared to 2% but can be the most satisfying.

Health benefits of cottage cheese
Cottage cheese may be mild in flavor, but it packs a punch when it comes to potential health benefits. Some of the many benefits of cottage cheese include:

Provides good nutrition
A 100-gram serving (just under a half cup) of low-fat (2%) cottage cheese provides:

Calories: 84.
Fat: 2.3 grams.
Protein: 11 grams.
Total sugars: 4.1 grams.
Calcium: 103 milligrams (8% of your daily value or DV).
Phosphorus: 148 milligrams (12% of DV).
Potassium: 120 milligrams (3% of DV).
Selenium: 14.6 micrograms (27% of DV).
Sodium: 321 milligrams (14% of DV).
Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture

Aids in weight loss
Three factors make cottage cheese a great choice if you're looking to lose pounds or maintain your weight:

High in protein: Research finds that eating a high-protein diet helps curb your appetite and manage hormones associated with appetite, digestion and insulin release.
Low in fat: Full-fat cottage cheese contains less fat than some other cheeses (4% fat versus 30% fat in cheddar), and its high protein makes it an excellent low-fat option.
Provides calcium: Studies show that increasing calcium can help you lose weight when combined with a calorie-restricted diet.
Cottage cheese isn't the only dairy food to provide these advantages. Greek yogurt can also check these boxes. But if you're deciding between the two, Zumpano recommends cottage cheese. ""Full-fat cottage cheese and full-fat Greek yogurt have the same amount of fat, but cottage cheese has 25% more protein.""

Provides essential amino acids
Cottage cheese is rich in casein (pronounced ""KAY-seen"") protein. It's a complete protein that provides essential amino acids, which are all the building blocks of protein that your body needs.

Amino acids help your body work smoothly. They affect your:

Appetite.
Energy production.
Immune system.
Mood.
Muscle growth.
Sleep.
""Eating cottage cheese as part of a balanced diet is an easy way to ensure your body gets everything it needs,"" says Zumpano.

Supports bone health
Cottage cheese has three nutrients that help promote healthy bones:

Calcium helps prevent osteoporosis that can lead to bone fractures.
Phosphorus is critical for proper bone development and strength, especially during growth spurts or when healing from a fracture.
Protein helps maintain bone mineral density and can reduce the risk of fractures.
""Bone health is critical as you age,"" Zumpano shares. ""Adding cottage cheese to your diet is an easy way to strengthen them.""

Helps you control blood sugar levels
Plain cottage cheese is low in carbohydrates, making it a great option for anyone watching their blood sugar. The slow-digesting casein protein in cottage cheese also helps prevent blood sugar spikes.

""To get this benefit of cottage cheese, choose plain cottage cheese,"" Zumpano recommends. ""Avoid cottage cheese pre-packaged with fruit and check the label for added sugar.""

Contributes to a balanced gut
Probiotics are live microorganisms that can improve the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut (gut microbiota). The curdling process used to produce cottage cheese adds beneficial bacteria that can promote better gut health. But unlike Greek and regular yogurt, which almost always contain probiotics, not all cottage cheese is created equal.

""If you want cottage cheese that provides probiotics,"" Zumpano says, ""check the label to see if it says it contains 'live and active cultures.'""

Promotes muscle development
The slow-release protein in cottage cheese doesn't just help with digestion. It's also important for building muscle tissue and helping your muscles recover after a workout.

""Casein protein provides your cells with amino acids consistently over a longer period, which helps muscles recover instead of breaking down,"" Zumpano explains. Consider having cottage cheese after a workout to get the maximum benefit for your muscles.

Reduces your risk of some cancers
Research shows that increasing dairy intake may lower your risk for some (though not all) cancers. ""There's still a lot to learn about the connection between dairy and cancer prevention,"" Zumpano states. ""But it's clear there are protective benefits to including dairy in a balanced diet.""

Experts believe getting more calcium may offer protection from:

Bladder cancer.
Breast cancer.
Colorectal cancer.
Stomach (gastric) cancer.
Tips for adding cottage cheese to your diet
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that adults get three cups of dairy daily. Cottage cheese can help you reach that goal.

When you incorporate cottage cheese into your diet, remember to:

Check the nutrition label: Single-serve containers of cottage cheese may vary in size and nutritional content.
Consider your lactose tolerance: The lactose in cheese decreases with age. As a fresh, unripened cheese, cottage cheese often contains more lactose than aged cheeses. If you have lactose intolerance, consider a cottage cheese that's lactose-free.
Keep an eye on sodium: Cottage cheese can be high in sodium, so opt for low-sodium or sodium-free cottage cheese to protect yourself from high blood pressure and heart disease.
Get creative: There are many ways to eat more cottage cheese. Consider adding cottage cheese to your eggs or pancake mix. Bake it into muffins or cakes. Or use it as a substitute for sour cream or ricotta cheese.";https://health.clevelandclinic.org/cottage-cheese-benefits;cottage cheese n't typically receive lot attention . gets left fancy cheese counter grocery store . n't make cut charcuterie ( meat cheese ) board . n't typically included recipes favorite foods pizza , grilled cheese baked ziti .

"Cheese making has been in practice for over 8,000 years by various cultures around the world. Throughout history, many animals have been valued for their milk, including camels, bison, goats, and yaks. Today, the majority of dairy production comes from cow's milk, increasing by 50% over the last 40 years. While the percentage of milk consumption in liquid form has decreased, the popularity of cheese has been on the rise, with each person eating an average of 34 pounds a year as of 2012 (1).
However, not all cheeses are created equal. Most cheeses get a bad rap. We hear about how it is unhealthy, negatively contributing to our waistline and increasing the number on the scale. While all cheeses should be eaten in moderation, there are some that are a good addition to your shopping list, including swiss, feta, part-skim mozzarella, parmesan, and cottage cheese (2). These are a great source of many essential vitamins and minerals, and can help you avoid common health issues.

1. Cheese Can Prevent Osteoporosis
Our parents always instructed us to drink our milk as children, telling us that the calcium and vitamin D would help us to build strong bones. The truth is our bone mass continues to grow throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching its peak density around age 30. From there, the aging process begins to thin our bones over time. It is easy to see that the greater your bone density is at this point, the less effect aging will have on your skeletal integrity.

Unfortunately, inadequate bone mass can contribute to the development of osteoporosis later in life. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by fragile, porous bones, and it affects over 10 million Americans, 80% of which are women. It is the leading cause of fractures, with 1.5 million estimated each year (particularly in the wrist, hip, or vertebrae). The cause can be attributed to low consumption or poor absorption of calcium, which causes the bones to slowly break down (3).

Balanced nutrition can help you avoid the development of osteoporosis. You need to ensure you are receiving adequate amounts or protein, calcium, and vitamin D. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum daily intake of 400 to 500 mg of calcium per day for people over 50 and at risk for fractures (4). Dairy products, particularly cheese fortified with vitamin D, can be a great way to consume the correct balance of vitamins and minerals.

Bottom Line: Increasing your calcium and protein intake with cheese can keep your bones strong, and help prevent osteoporosis.

2. Cheese Can Have a Positive Effect on Your Dental Health
A study done by dental professionals showed that eating cheese might help to prevent dental cavities. Four groups were tested, consuming milk, sugar-free yogurt, paraffin, and cheese, and the pH balance in various areas of their mouths were tested before and after consumption. A pH level lower than 5.5 can leave your teeth at risk for erosion due to acids created in your mouth. While the groups who drank milk, and ate paraffin and sugar-free yogurt showed no significant change, the group who ate cheese experienced an increase in pH levels (5).

The findings may be the result of increased saliva production, due to chewing, which protects teeth from erosion. It could also be that certain components of the cheese adhered to the teeth, protecting them from acid. Either way, your teeth are made up of the same substances as your bones. Just as cheese is beneficial for your bone health, it can also have positive effects on your dental health.

Bottom Line: Cheese can keep your teeth strong and prevent expensive dental work that results from decay.

3. Cheese Consumption Can Help You Gain Weight in a Healthy Way
To most people, the idea of gaining weight is not something to be looked at favorably. For some, weight gain is a necessity for various reasons. Actors and athletes may need to bulk up for an upcoming role or game season, or a child may be underweight for their age, according to their pediatrician.

For those looking to gain weight, there is a right and a wrong way to do so. You do not want to put your health at risk by choosing the wrong foods. With its fat and protein content, plus the various vitamins and minerals it contains, cheese is a great choice for gaining weight in a healthy manner (6).

You do need to be careful about how much cheese you eat, as it can take you too far to the opposite extreme on the weight chart. It is a very energy-dense food, containing a lot of calories per gram. Common cheeses, like goat, gouda, and parmesan, contain over 100 calories per gram. Eating a diet mainly consisting of foods high in energy density can lead to obesity. Try to balance your cheese intake with low energy-dense foods, like fruits and vegetables (7).

Bottom Line: If your doctor has said that you or your child needs to gain weight, cheese can be a healthy way to achieve this.

4. Cheese is the Best Dietary Source for Calcium
The most abundant mineral in the body, calcium is a necessity for life. It regulates vascular function, nerve transmission, muscle function, and hormone secretion. While only 1% of the calcium in the body is necessary for these functions, the other 99% is stored in the bones.

Your bones go through constant remodeling throughout your life. The balance between breakdown and formation changes over time, with the formation greatly outweighing breakdown in childhood, vice versa in older adults, and a balance between the two in adolescence and early adulthood (8).

Our bodies cannot create new calcium, and we lose calcium every day through our dead skin cells, nails and hair, sweat, and excrement. It is important to get your recommended daily calcium (roughly 1,000 mg for the average adult (9)), as the calcium we do not receive through our food is then taken from our bones, leaving them prone to breaking down and vulnerable to fractures (10).

Bottom Line: Cheese is the best way, without supplementation, to receive your recommended daily intake of calcium.

5. Cheese is an Excellent Source of Protein
Responsible for the formation, regulation, repair, and protection of the body, protein is a necessity in our diets, giving you a strong immune system, healthy hair, and proper fluid balance in your body. Without proper protein intake, you are at risk for fluid retention and shrinkage of muscular tissue.

Your body does not store protein. Because of this, your daily food consumption should contain adequate amounts of protein. About 2-3 servings of protein-rich foods (such as meat and dairy) per day is adequate for most adults to meet the requirement (11).

While most cheeses are an excellent source of protein, low moisture-content cheeses are your best choice. If you are looking for the best cheesy source of protein, Parmesan is the one for you. It is the highest protein-content cheese, with 10 grams per ounce. Stay away from ""wet"" cheeses, like cottage, ricotta, and other cheese spreads if you are looking for protein content. These are very low in protein and high in fat (12).

Bottom Line: Cheese can help you receive your daily amounts of protein, giving you leaner muscle and healthier skin and hair.

6. Cheese is High in Vitamin B12
Vitamin B-12 (also known as Cobalamin) is the largest and most complex vitamin discovered to this day. It aids in the production of red blood cells, protein, and DNA, as well as promotes many mental health functions. Vitamin B-12 anemia, or pernicious anemia, is the result of a deficiency which can lead to lethargy, muscles weakness, and, in long-term, severe cases, neurological damage (13).

This essential vitamin can only be found, naturally, in animal products, or synthetically in supplements. It can be consumed in large doses with no ill side-effects. The excess merely gets stored away in the body until it is needed, and can be stored up to a year (14).

Many cheeses provide an excellent source of natural vitamin B-12. Amongst all cheeses, Swiss has been found to have the highest B-12 content, with 0.95 micrograms per ounce. That's about 39% of your recommended daily intake. Even the cheeses with the lowest content, cheddar and Monterey, still offer 10% of your B-12 requirement in one ounce (15).

Bottom Line: Choosing cheeses, like Swiss, can energize you and keep your nervous system healthy through vitamin B-12.

7. Cheese Can Reverse Hypertension by Lowering Blood Pressure
There have been links found between a diet that contains dairy and lower blood pressure. It is believed that the increased calcium intake is what is ultimately responsible. There was a study done in which two groups, one who ate only fruits and vegetables and the other included low-fat dairy products, were tested. It was found that the group that included dairy showed overall decreased blood pressure.

Those with hypertension may find that their systolic blood pressure lowered by 2-4 mmHg by including certain cheeses in their diet (16). However, you do still need to be aware of your sodium intake, not exceeding 1,500 mg per day. Choose low-sodium cheeses by checking the packaging labels. Balancing your diet with foods high in potassium can help to reduce your sodium level as well (17). So, why not top that potato with some cheddar?

Bottom Line: Pairing low-sodium cheeses with potassium-rich foods can lower your blood pressure and reverse hypertension.

8. Cheese Provides the Essential Fat, CLA
Conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA, is a complex compound that does not get enough credit. With the trend of low-fat, no-fat diets, the intake of CLA amongst most Americans is very low. It is an essential, ""healthy"" fat that is commonly found in dairy and meat, primarily from grass-fed cows, sheep, and goats (18).

With the help of CLA, you can experience a loss of body fat and build lean muscle. It also plays a vital role in supporting the immune and inflammatory systems, improving bone mass, regulating blood sugar levels, and reducing your risk of heart disease.

Cheese made from milk from grass-fed cows tends to be high in CLA's. The amount of CLA in these cheeses tend to increase with the amount of fresh grass eaten. Therefore, when cows have access year-round to fresh grass, you can have as much as 30 mg of CLA per ounce of cheese produced (19).

Bottom Line: Grass-fed cheeses are rich in CLA, which can regulate your blood sugar and reduce your risk of heart failure.

9. Cheese Can Help Prevent Common Cancers
There's no doubt about it: cancer runs rampant throughout our population. Colorectal cancer is amongst the most common in the world, affecting the colon and digestive tract. Many complications come along with colorectal cancer, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, rectal bleeding, and, if undiagnosed, can lead to death in the long-run (20).

While many studies have shown mixed results when it comes to dairy consumption and cancer risk, there has been some evidence that shows milk and cheese can prevent some common cancers, such as colorectal and bladder. There are many factors to consider when it comes to diet and cancer prevention. When it comes to cheese and other dairy products, it is believed that the calcium, vitamin D, and lactic acid can potentially protect you from these cancers (21, 22).

Bottom Line: The calcium content in cheese can potentially help prevent common cancers, like colorectal.

10. Cheese is Plentiful in Healthy Fats
Once upon a time, we were told that fat was evil, causing us to be obese and clogging up our precious arteries. Thus, the low-fat, no-fat diets began to roll out, resulting in a population that was overweight and very sick.

Now we know that fats are essential to a healthy diet. They help to keep you full, so you eat less, and are necessary to help your body absorb certain vitamins. It is still only recommended that 10% or less of your daily calories should come from fat, and you should be selective with where your fats come from and what type of fats you choose.

Unsaturated fats are the best for you. These are typically found in nuts and fish. Saturated fats can also be good, but in moderation. These are often solid at room temperature, and are found in animal products, like meat, butter, and cheese, and certain oils, like coconut and palm. Trans fats should be avoided altogether, being undeniably the worst fat for your heart and found in fried foods and packaged snacks.

Cheese, in moderation, can help you get these necessary fats into your diet. Try choosing aged cheeses, like parmesan, and using it as a garnish to salads. The fats in the cheese will help keep you full and help your body absorb the vitamins in your vegetables (23).

Bottom Line: We now know that fats are essential in our diets, and cheese is a good source of healthy dietary fats.

11. Cheese is a Good Choice for Pregnant Women
Preeclampsia affects 5 to 8% of pregnant women in America. It is a condition in which a woman develops hypertension in pregnancy, and can have a serious impact on her unborn child, including death. Through various studies and research, it has been shown, however, that calcium supplementation, receiving between 1,500 and 2,000 mg per day, during pregnancy can greatly reduce a woman's risk of developing preeclampsia (24).

With its calcium content, cheese is a good choice for the pregnant woman's diet. Not only is it rich in calcium, but it can offer many other essential nutrients for pregnancy, including protein and B vitamins. However, there are many conflicting opinions on the consumption of cheese during pregnancy, and these need to be taken into consideration.

Some soft cheeses, due to their moisture content, can be the perfect environment for bacteria to grow. One of these bacteria, listeria, is especially dangerous for pregnant women and their fetuses. Listeriosis can produce symptoms similar to that of food poisoning, and the bacterial infection can even result in fetal death (25).

If you do choose to eat soft cheese, make sure it is in cooked food. The heat will help to kill the bacteria, making it safer for pregnant women to eat. If you really desire to eat cheese, but you are afraid of the risk of listeriosis, choose hard cheeses instead, like gouda, cheddar, and parmesan. These are usually made with pasteurized milk and cooked at high temperatures, which kill any existing bacteria (26).

Bottom Line: With proper choices and preparation, cheese can be a good choice for pregnant women to receive vitamins and minerals necessary for healthy fetal development.

12. Cheese Helps You Build Muscle
We all know how difficult it can be to lose weight, but for some people, it can be just as hard to put on muscle. Adding certain foods to your diet, however, can help you gain weight and bulk up. Cheese can effectively help you build muscle, due to its fat and protein content (27).

Cottage cheese is easily the cheapest addition to your diet that can help you build muscle. Per serving (about 4 ounces), you get 13 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat (in regular cottage cheese, not low- or no-fat), and 4 grams of carbs. It is a popular choice amongst many athletes and body builders, as the whey and casein protein keeps their muscles lean and aids in post-workout recovery (28).

Bottom Line: With the protein, fat, and carbs in cheese, you can gain weight and build muscle with ease.

13. Cheese Benefits the Immune System
Immunoesenescene is a disease that plagues the elderly, attacking their immune system, leading to its deterioration. It makes it harder for their bodies to fight cancerous cells and respond to immunizations and vaccines, leaving them more susceptible to cancer and infectious diseases.

Recent research, however, has shown that cheese, fortified with probiotic bacteria, can help boost the immune system and prevent immunosenescene. Probiotics are similar to the bacteria found in the human gut, where the majority of the immune system is located. Scientists, therefore, decided to target this area for their research.

A group of volunteers in a nursing home, between the ages of 72 and 103, were observed over a period of four weeks. One group was given a placebo cheese, and the other was given probiotic-rich gouda. At the end of the period, it was clear that natural and acquired immunity was improved in the group who ate the probiotic-fortified gouda (29, 30).

Bottom Line: Cheese, especially gouda, can improve the immune system by introducing gut-healthy probiotics to your body.

14. Cheese is Abundant in the Vital Vitamin K2
Vitamin K is well-known for the role it plays in helping your blood to clot, but there are a few forms of vitamin K. Vitamin K2 doesn't get as much attention as K1, which is the K vitamin responsible for blood coagulation (called Koagulationsvitamin, understandably). It is believed to be the ""unsung hero"" when it comes to the prevention of some common diseases (31).

This vitamin works hand-in-hand with other vitamins and nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D. It benefits your bone, skin, and dental health, by transporting and depositing these essential vitamins and minerals to these areas. It can help prevent dementia in the elderly by promoting healthy brain function. It can even prevent, and possibly treat, common cancers, like leukemia (32).

Many Americans (about 80%), and other Western populations, are believed to not get enough of this magical vitamin. The optimum recommended intake is still inconclusive, but it is believed that 180 to 200 mcg per day will be enough to get those vitamin-transporting proteins working. Hard cheeses, have adequate amounts of vitamin K2, offering over 30% more than soft cheeses, and amongst these, gouda and brie boast the highest amounts, at about 75 mcg per ounce (33, 34).

Bottom Line: Vitamin K2 is a miracle vitamin, believed to help prevent many common diseases, and gouda cheese is an excellent source for this vitamin.

15. Cheese is Good for Your Thyroid Health
Your thyroid, a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, is probably not something you think about often, but it should receive special attention when it comes to your health. The hormones it produces regulate nearly all of the body's metabolic functions. Too much (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism) production of these hormones can set your body off balance.

A thyroid disorder can have a vast array of symptoms. These include weight gain, fatigue, and infertility with hypothyroidism, and anxiety, insomnia, and rapid weight loss with hyperthyroidism. Both are cause for concern, and can lead to more serious problems in the future.

More than 30 million Americans suffer from a thyroid disorder, and over half of them are undiagnosed. Chances are even higher of an issue developing with your thyroid if you are female, making it about 30% more likely (35, 36).

There are many things you can do to prevent developing a thyroid disorder, such as nutrition. Selenium is an essential mineral, as there are many benefits that result from daily intake. You can experience boosted immunity, as it counteracts the development of viruses, and it regulates thyroid function by aiding in the production of thyroid hormones (37).

Changing your diet can be the first step to avoiding a thyroid disorder. Adding cheese to your diet can help. Hard cheeses, like cheddar, can be a great source of selenium. In a 100-g serving, you can get over 50% of your recommended daily value (38).

Bottom Line: Adding cheddar, and other hard cheeses, to your diet can reduce your risk of developing a thyroid disorder by keeping your hormones in balance.

"You've probably seen plenty of headlines about the fact that processed meat has been classified as a 'definite' cause of cancer. And red meat is a 'probable' cause.

The decision - coordinated by a respected international body - has been so highly anticipated by the media that speculation about the announcement has been building since last week.

But a link between certain types of meat and some forms of cancer - notably bowel cancer - isn't 'new' news - the evidence has been building for decades, and is supported by a lot of careful research.

Nevertheless, today's announcement is significant. It comes from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - a group of international experts who scrutinise the overall evidence - in this case more than 800 studies - on how likely certain things are to cause cancer. Their decisions carry a lot of clout, especially with governments and regulators.

But what does the finding - published here in the Lancet Oncology - mean in practice? How much meat is it sensible to eat? And how many cases of cancer are linked to meat consumption?

In this post, we'll look at what IARC's classification actually means, how red and processed meat affect cancer risk, and the likely size of this effect.

But before we move on, let's be clear: yes, a prolonged high-meat diet isn't terribly good for you. But a steak, bacon sandwich or sausage bap a few times a week probably isn't much to worry about. And overall the risks are much lower than for other things linked to cancer - such as smoking.

What are 'red' and 'processed' meat?
First, let's clear up some definitions.

'Red' meat is (as you might expect), any meat that's a dark red colour before it's cooked -  this obviously means meats like  beef and lamb, but also includes pork.

'Processed' meat is meat that's not sold fresh, but instead has been cured, salted, smoked, or otherwise preserved in some way (so things like bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, salami, and pepperoni). But this doesn't include fresh burgers or mince.

Both of these types of meat are distinct from 'white' meats, like fresh chicken or turkey, and fish (neither of which appear to increase your risk of cancer).

The evidence so far…
There's now a large body of evidence that bowel cancer is more common among people who eat the most red and processed meat. As this evidence has steadily built up, we've blogged about it several times - and it's covered on the NHS Choices website and by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF).

(There's also growing evidence for a possible link to both stomach and pancreatic cancers, but this seems to be less clear cut than the link to bowel cancer.)

The most convincing overview of the evidence of a link to bowel cancer comes from a 2011 analysis by researchers at the WCRF, who combined the results of a number of previous studies, to try to get a clear sense of the overall picture.

They were able to group the data according to those who ate the most red and processed meat and those who ate the least. A key finding from the WCRF analysis is that red meat and processed meat aren't equally harmful: processed meat is more strongly linked to bowel cancer than red meat.

The results showed that those who ate the most processed meat had around a 17 per cent higher risk of developing bowel cancer, compared to those who ate the least.

'17 per cent' sounds like a fairly big number - but this is a 'relative' risk, so let's put it into perspective, and convert it to absolute numbers. Remember these are all ball-park figures - everyone's risk will be different as there are many different factors at play.

We know that, out of every 1000 people in the UK, about 61 will develop bowel cancer at some point in their lives. Those who eat the lowest amount of processed meat are likely to have a lower lifetime risk than the rest of the population (about 56 cases per 1000 low meat-eaters).

If this is correct, the WCRF's analysis suggests that, among 1000 people who eat the most processed meat, you'd expect 66 to develop bowel cancer at some point in their lives - 10 more than the group who eat the least processed meat.

How does red and processed meat cause cancer?
Researchers are still trying to pin down exactly how red and processed meat cause cells to become cancerous, but the main culprits seem to be certain chemicals found in the meat itself.

In red meat, the problems seem to start when a chemical called haem - part of the red pigment in the blood, haemoglobin - is broken down in our gut to form a family of chemicals called N-nitroso compounds. These have been found to damage the cells that line the bowel, so other cells in the bowel lining have to replicate more in order to heal. And it's this 'extra' replication that can increase the chance of errors developing in the cells' DNA - the first step on the road to cancer.

On top of this, processed red meats contain chemicals that generate N-nitroso compounds in the gut, such as nitrite preservatives.

Cooking meat at high temperatures, such as grilling or barbequing, can also create chemicals in the meat that may increase the risk of cancer. These chemicals are generally produced in higher levels in red and processed meat compared to other meats.

But there are other theories too - some research has suggested that the iron in red meat could play a role, while others suggest the bacteria in the gut might play a supporting role too.

So despite what you may hear, it isn't about the quality of the meat, or whether it's from the local butcher or your supermarket. The evidence so far suggests that it's probably the processing of the meat, or chemicals naturally present within it, that increases cancer risk.

What does this decision from IARC mean?
Whatever the underlying mechanism, there's now sufficient evidence for IARC to rule that  processed meat 'definitely' causes cancer, and that red meat 'probably' causes cancer. But to really understand what this means (and doesn't mean), you need to know a bit about IARC's categories.

When IARC assesses the evidence on a particular cancer risk, it assigns it to one of several groups, which - as the graphic below shows - represent how confident they are that it causes cancer in people.

Processed meat has been classified as a 'definite' cause of cancer (or Group 1 carcinogen) - the same group that includes smoking and alcohol. And red meat is a 'probable' cause of cancer (or a Group 2a carcinogen) - the same group as shift work. While this may sound alarming, it's important to remember that these groups show how confident IARC is that red and processed meat cause cancer, not how much cancer they cause.

In 2011, scientists estimated that around 3 in every hundred cancers in the UK were due to eating too much red and processed meat (that's around 8,800 cases every year). This compares against 64,500 cases every year caused by smoking (or 19 per cent of all cancers).

So what does this mean for mealtimes?

Does red and processed meat still have a place in a healthy diet?
None of this means that a single meat-based meal is 'bad for you'. What it does mean is that regularly eating large amounts of red and processed meat, over a long period of time, is probably not the best approach if you're aiming to live a long and healthy life. Meat is fine in moderation - it's a good source of some nutrients such as protein, iron and zinc. It's just about being sensible, and not eating too much, too often.

So how much is a 'sensible' amount of meat? This is a much trickier question to answer. The evidence so far doesn't point to a particular amount that's, in terms of cancer risk, likely to be 'too much'. All we can say is that on the whole, the risk is lower the less you eat. Based on a  range of health considerations, the Government advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and/or processed meat a day should cut down to 70g or less.

So if you're someone who has a very meaty diet, and you're worried about cancer, you may want to think about cutting down. That doesn't mean you need to start stocking up on tofu, unless you want to, it just means trying to eat smaller and fewer portions (by adding in more vegetables, beans and pulses - remember the eatwell plate?), or choosing chicken or fish instead. As we said above, there's no strong evidence linking fresh white meats such as chicken, turkey, or fish to any types of cancer.

So our advice on diet stays the same: eat plenty of fibre, fruit and vegetables; cut back on red and processed meat, and salt; and limit your alcohol intake. It might sound boring but it's true: healthy living is all about moderation.

Except for smoking: that's always bad for you.

"For patients diagnosed with cancer, is there one diet that is better than another? Dr. Dawn Mussallem, an integrative health specialist at Mayo Clinic, says it's not about one food or diet, but rather a dietary pattern that emphasizes a predominant plant-based diet that is high in fiber. And, Dr. Mussallem says, 97% of Americans aren't getting enough fiber.
""It's the dietary pattern that the organizations, such as the American Institute for Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society, recommend is a plant-predominant diet that has an emphasis on whole foods,"" says Dr. Mussallem.

That includes a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds,

""It's good to have whole grains, not processed grains, but whole grains,"" she says.

Skip ultraprocessed foods. Limit or avoid red and processed meats. The American Cancer Society says it's unknown if there is a safe level of consumption for either red or processed meats.

""Processed meat is considered a carcinogen. And to replace some of that red meat component where folks get protein, you want to lean in on consumption of pulses,"" says Dr. Mussallem.

Pulses include legumes, or beans, lentils and peas. You'll add protein - and fiber.

"Scientific review published in Advances in Nutrition finds there is no simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to this question
Cancer, the leading cause of death globally, accounted for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Despite extensive research, the association between dairy consumption and cancer mortality has varied among studies and therefore has remained unclear.  Moreover, most studies examining the relationship between dairy consumption and cancer mortality have focused on dairy consumption in general, without examining the effects of specific types of dairy products on specific populations.

In response, nutrition scientists Shaoyue Jin and Youjin Je conducted a comprehensive scientific review to quantitatively assess the association between the consumption of total dairy products, as well as specific types of dairy products, and total cancer mortality.  Furthermore, the review authors examined the effect of gender, cancer site, fat content, and geographic region on cancer mortality.  The results of their research, ""Dairy Consumption and Total Cancer and Cancer-Specific Mortality: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies,"" were published in Advances in Nutrition, the international review journal of the American Society for Nutrition.

To conduct their research, the authors performed a comprehensive search of prospective cohort studies published up to March 2021 that examined the association between dairy consumption and cancer mortality.  Their search led them to 34 studies, which together included more than three million participants.  On average, these studies tracked participants' health status for about 14 years.  Seventeen studies were conducted in the United States, eight in Asia, eight in Europe, and one in Oceania.

Interestingly, when the authors looked at the relationship between total dairy consumption and total cancer mortality, no significant associations were found.  However, when the authors examined the relationship between specific types of dairy and cancer mortality, significant associations did emerge.  For example, the authors discovered a significant association between milk consumption and total cancer mortality among females, but not among males.  More specifically, for women's cancer, high milk consumption was associated with increased mortality risk from ovarian cancer, but no significant association was detected for breast cancer.

In contrast to milk consumption, the authors discovered that high consumption of fermented milk products such as yogurt was associated with a lower total cancer mortality among females, but not among males.  The authors found that ""increasing fermented milk consumption by 200 grams per day was associated with a 10% decrease in total cancer mortality in females, whereas no association was found in males.""  These findings may be due to the lower lactose and galactose content of fermented milk products.  Studies have shown that lactose and galactose consumption are associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

The effect of consuming other types of dairy products did not differ by gender.  For example, high cheese consumption was associated with an increased risk of death from colorectal cancer equally for men and women.

The authors acknowledge that their scientific review has some limitations.  In particular, their review was based on observational studies, rather than randomized controlled trials which tend to produce more reliable results.  The authors therefore caution that ""future well-designed large prospective cohort studies that investigate the association between each type of dairy product and cancer mortality in different cancer sites and populations are warranted.""";https://nutrition.org/is-there-a-link-between-dairy-consumption-and-cancer-mortality/;scientific review published advances nutrition finds simple `` yes '' `` '' answer question cancer , leading cause death globally , accounted nearly 10 million deaths 2020 , according world health organization ( ) . despite extensive research , association dairy consumption cancer mortality varied among studies therefore remained unclear . moreover , studies examining relationship dairy consumption cancer mortality focused dairy consumption general , without examining effects specific types dairy products specific populations . response , nutrition scientists shaoyue jin youjin je conducted comprehensive scientific review quantitatively assess association consumption total dairy products , well specific types dairy products , total cancer mortality . furthermore , review authors examined effect gender , cancer site , fat content , geographic region cancer mortality . results research , `` dairy consumption total cancer cancer-specific mortality : meta-analysis prospective cohort studies , '' published advances nutrition , international review journal american society nutrition . conduct research , authors performed comprehensive search prospective cohort studies published march 2021 examined association dairy consumption cancer mortality . search led 34 studies , together included three million participants . average , studies tracked participants ' health status 14 years . seventeen studies conducted united states , eight asia , eight europe , one oceania . interestingly , authors looked relationship total dairy consumption total cancer mortality , significant associations found . however , authors examined relationship specific types dairy cancer mortality , significant associations emerge . example , authors discovered significant association milk consumption total cancer mortality among females , among males . specifically , women 's cancer , high milk consumption associated increased mortality risk ovarian cancer , significant association detected breast cancer . contrast milk consumption , authors discovered high consumption fermented milk products yogurt associated lower total cancer mortality among females , among males . authors found `` increasing fermented milk consumption 200 grams per day associated 10 % decrease total cancer mortality females , whereas association found males .

"If you've been waiting for an excuse to chow down on cheeseburgers and cheddar franks - relish this moment.

Scientists at the University of Chicago have discovered that a compound in red meat, dairy and other products might help your body's immune cells fight off tumors.

The compound, known as trans-vaccenic acid or TVA, seems to activate the T cells in your body, which help your immune system fight germs and protect you from disease.

TVA is found in the meat of ruminants such as cows, sheep and other mammals, and their dairy products like milk, cheese, butter and yogurt.

Published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the study also finds that cancer patients who have higher levels of TVA in their blood had a better response to immunotherapy.

That discovery suggested to the researchers that TVA might be useful as a supplement during cancer treatment.

""To see that a single nutrient like TVA has a very targeted mechanism on a targeted immune cell type, with a very profound physiological response at the whole organism level - I find that really amazing and intriguing,"" Jing Chen, a cancer researcher at the University of Chicago, told South West News Service.

The researchers started with a database of around 700 known metabolites, which are small molecules that come from food. They then screened the metabolites for their anti-cancer abilities.

After the top six compounds were chosen, scientists evaluated their cancer-fighting abilities in human and mouse cells - TVA performed the best in fighting the development of tumors.

The researchers also found that feeding mice a diet rich in TVA significantly reduced the tumor growth of melanoma and colon cancer cells, and enhanced the body's ability to infiltrate and attack tumors.

They also analyzed blood samples from lymphoma patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment. That led to the discovery that patients who had higher levels of TVA in their blood responded better to treatment than patients with lower levels.

Finally, the study revealed that TVA enhanced the ability of an immunotherapy drug to kill leukemia cells in patients.

""There are many studies trying to decipher the link between diet and human health, and it's very difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms because of the wide variety of foods people eat,"" Chen said.

""But if we focus on just the nutrients and metabolites derived from food, we begin to see how they influence physiology and pathology,"" Chen added.

""By focusing on nutrients that can activate T cell responses, we found one that actually enhances anti-tumor immunity by activating an important immune pathway.""

But - to the dismay of many - the study authors stop short of advising people to eat more red meat and dairy.

""There is a growing body of evidence about the detrimental health effects of consuming too much red meat and dairy,"" Chen added, ""so this study shouldn't be taken as an excuse to eat more cheeseburgers and pizza.""

Instead, the researchers are searching for a similar compound in plants that has the same robust tumor-fighting abilities.

""There is early data showing that other fatty acids from plants signal through a similar receptor, so we believe there is a high possibility that nutrients from plants can do the same thing,"" Chen said.";https://nypost.com/2023/11/22/lifestyle/eating-red-meat-and-dairy-could-help-fight-cancer-new-study/;'ve waiting excuse chow cheeseburgers cheddar franks - relish moment . scientists university chicago discovered compound red meat , dairy products might help body 's immune cells fight tumors . compound , known trans-vaccenic acid tva , seems activate cells body , help immune system fight germs protect disease . tva found meat ruminants cows , sheep mammals , dairy products like milk , cheese , butter yogurt . published wednesday journal nature , study also finds cancer patients higher levels tva blood better response immunotherapy . discovery suggested researchers tva might useful supplement cancer treatment . `` see single nutrient like tva targeted mechanism targeted immune cell type , profound physiological response whole organism level - find really amazing intriguing , '' jing chen , cancer researcher university chicago , told south west news service . researchers started database around 700 known metabolites , small molecules come food . screened metabolites anti-cancer abilities . top six compounds chosen , scientists evaluated cancer-fighting abilities human mouse cells - tva performed best fighting development tumors . researchers also found feeding mice diet rich tva significantly reduced tumor growth melanoma colon cancer cells , enhanced body 's ability infiltrate attack tumors . also analyzed blood samples lymphoma patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment . led discovery patients higher levels tva blood responded better treatment patients lower levels . finally , study revealed tva enhanced ability immunotherapy drug kill leukemia cells patients . `` many studies trying decipher link diet human health , 's difficult understand underlying mechanisms wide variety foods people eat , '' chen said . `` focus nutrients metabolites derived food , begin see influence physiology pathology , '' chen added . `` focusing nutrients activate cell responses , found one actually enhances anti-tumor immunity activating important immune pathway .

"Abstract
Background: Plant-based dietary patterns may affect colorectal cancer (CRC) related outcomes, while risks differ in the quality of plant foods. We aimed to examine the association of plant-based diet quality with risks of CRC incidence and mortality and whether this association was modified by genetic risk.

Methods: This prospective cohort study included 186,675 participants free of cancer when the last dietary recall was completed. We calculated three plant-based diet indices (PDIs), i.e., the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and the unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) representing adherence to plant-based diets with diverse quality. Genetic risk was characterized using a weighted polygenic risk score (PRS), capturing overall risk variants associated with CRC. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) were estimated by the cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model.

Results: Over a follow-up of 9.5 years, 2163 cases and 466 deaths from CRC were documented. The HR of CRC incidence was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99) per 10-score increase in PDI and hPDI, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile, PDI, hPDI, and uPDI in the highest quartile were associated with a 13% decrease, a 15% decrease, and a 14% increase in risk of incident CRC, respectively. We found a joint association of genetic risk and PDIs with incident CRC, with the highest hazard observed in those carrying higher PRS and adhering to lower-quality PDIs. The inverse association of PDI and hPDI with CRC mortality was pronounced in males.

Conclusions: Our results suggested that better adherence to overall and healthful plant-based diets was associated with a lower risk of CRC, whereas an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with a higher CRC risk. Consumption of a higher-quality plant-based diet combined with decreased genetic risk conferred less susceptibility to CRC. Our findings highlighted the importance of food quality when adhering to a plant-based dietary pattern for CRC prevention in the general population.";https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37759216/;abstract background : plant-based dietary patterns may affect colorectal cancer ( crc ) related outcomes , risks differ quality plant foods . aimed examine association plant-based diet quality risks crc incidence mortality whether association modified genetic risk . methods : prospective cohort study included 186,675 participants free cancer last dietary recall completed . calculated three plant-based diet indices ( pdis ) , i.e. , overall plant-based diet index ( pdi ) , healthful plant-based diet index ( hpdi ) , unhealthful plant-based diet index ( updi ) representing adherence plant-based diets diverse quality . genetic risk characterized using weighted polygenic risk score ( prs ) , capturing overall risk variants associated crc . hazard ratios ( hr ) 95 % confidential intervals ( ci ) estimated cause-specific cox proportional hazards model . results : follow-up 9.5 years , 2163 cases 466 deaths crc documented . hr crc incidence 0.88 ( 95 % ci , 0.81-0.96 ) 0.91 ( 95 % ci , 0.84-0.99 ) per 10-score increase pdi hpdi , respectively . compared lowest quartile , pdi , hpdi , updi highest quartile associated 13 % decrease , 15 % decrease , 14 % increase risk incident crc , respectively . found joint association genetic risk pdis incident crc , highest hazard observed carrying higher prs adhering lower-quality pdis . inverse association pdi hpdi crc mortality pronounced males . conclusions : results suggested better adherence overall healthful plant-based diets associated lower risk crc , whereas unhealthful plant-based diet associated higher crc risk . consumption higher-quality plant-based diet combined decreased genetic risk conferred less susceptibility crc . findings highlighted importance food quality adhering plant-based dietary pattern crc prevention general population .
"The last thing cheese-lovers need is a health expert to justify their obsession. In their eyes, a stiff, smelly block of fromage needs no defense. Yet for the waistline conscious, more cajoling may be needed to convince them they can be eating cheese for good health.

That cheese can be a dieter's friend will come as a surprise to many. It has a reputation as a fatty, sodium-filled indulgence, and there's no denying that it's rich in both; just an ounce (about a slice) of cheddar cheese will run you 9 grams of fat and 180 mg of sodium. It's also high in saturated fat and cholesterol.

For a long time, these stats made cheese an automatic nutritional no-no. ""We used to assess whether a food is good or bad for your health simply by looking at a label and reading some of the basic information,"" says Arne Astrup, head of the department of nutrition, exercise and sports at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. (Astrup has received accepted grants from dairy foundations and companies, yet says the research he conducts is ""not biased due to industry influence."") Recent research, from Astrup and others, is showing that the thousands of molecules that make up cheese are working in ways that make the food beneficial to health.

Some of these attributes are obvious but others less so. Here's what new research pinpoints as some of the nutritional perks of cheese.

It's high in protein, calcium and hard-to-get B12. Cheese contains almost as much protein as it does fat, which the body uses to build cell structures and stay full. It also contains plenty of bone-building calcium-200 mg per ounce in cheddar cheese, or about 20% of a person's recommended daily amount-and is one of the few foods to naturally contain vitamin D. Cheese, too, has vitamin B12, which helps red blood cells form properly and neurological function.
It may help your heart. One such study (funded in part by a dairy group, which is typical with cheese research) finds that not only is cheese not bad for the heart, it may even be beneficial. A 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that eating a little more than an ounce of cheese daily was linked to about a 3% lower risk of stroke. A daily serving of cheese has also been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and eating cheese moderately has been found to predict a longer life. Cheese has even been shown to lower levels of bad LDL cholesterol compared to butter.
It doesn't increase high blood pressure risk. What's more, its high sodium content may not be so bad after all. Salty as it is, cheese wasn't linked to hypertension in another analysis of studies. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how this can be. ""There's a lot of magic in the food matrix of cheese, and the other components and ingredients in cheese are far more important than the saturated fat and sodium,"" says Astrup. Calcium seems to play a protective role by binding some of the fatty acids in cheese so that they can't be digested, he says.
It's full of good bacteria. The bacteria in cheese-which is a fermented food-might also be beneficial. Some evidence suggests that eating cheese favorably changes the microbiota, the concentration of bugs in the gut, which in turn may be improving metabolism.
It contains a particularly great fatty acid. Gökhan Hotamisligil, professor of genetics and metabolism at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, believes that the reason cheese can be so high in nutritional baddies without having detrimental health effects is that nutrition categories are too broad. ""The general view about fat is very crude,"" he says. ""We say fatty acids, but there are thousands of fatty acids, and they cannot all be conducting the same biology."" In 2008, Hotamisligil and his team were searching for the most unique lipids they could find when they stumbled upon palmitoleate. ""It turns out that this is really a wonderful fatty acid,"" he says. It's generated by the body in small amounts, but it's found most abundantly in full-fat dairy products-especially cheese. Palmitoleate neutralizes the damage caused by saturated fatty acids, acts like insulin by getting excess sugar out of the blood and is anti-inflammatory, Hotamisligil says. Together, these properties can help protect against excessive lipids and type-2 diabetes, he says.
This may help explain why full-fat dairy products, like cheese, haven't been shown to be nutritional bogeymen. ""From an evolutionary perspective, the survival of mammalians depended on drinking milk,"" says Hotamisligil. The lipid palmitoleate might exist in order to counter the fattiness of milk so that it doesn't cause harmful effects, he says.

A study in September found that when palmitoleate was fed to mice with extremely high cholesterol and a good chance of developing cardiovascular disease, it reduced inflammation and helped prevent heart disease.

More research is needed to unwrap the mysteries of cheese. But the good news for cheese-philes today is that eating it moderately seems to be just fine for most people. ""Now I eat my cheese without feeling guilty,"" says Hotamisligil-and so can you.";https://time.com/4619162/cheese-health-food-cholesterol/;"last thing cheese-lovers need health expert justify obsession . eyes , stiff , smelly block fromage needs defense . yet waistline conscious , cajoling may needed convince eating cheese good health . cheese dieter 's friend come surprise many . reputation fatty , sodium-filled indulgence , 's denying 's rich ; ounce ( slice ) cheddar cheese run 9 grams fat 180 mg sodium .

"Grains are made from edible seeds or kernels, in their whole form, these contain three components—the endosperm, the germ, and the bran. Refined grains, found in cakes, cookies, or white bread, are processed to remove these three components. Whole grains contain all components of the kernel making them a rich source of fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals.

How whole grains effect type 2 diabetes management
Whole grains are believed to help prevent diabetes and weight gain. When researchers investigate links between diet and diabetes, one of the most consistent findings is that people who eat more whole grains are less likely to develop this disease.

Wheat is by far the most popular grain in the United States, and is the third most commonly eaten grain worldwide. Breads, pastas, bulgur, couscous, spelt (a relative of wheat) and many breakfast cereals are all derived from wheat. When eaten in their whole grain form, these foods provide insoluble fiber and phytochemicals that have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

Types of whole grain
Read the ingredients and make sure it says whole wheat to ensure it is 100% whole grain or look for the whole grain symbol.

Corn
If you have been snubbing corn as a starchy food that has no place in your diabetes eating plan—you may reconsider after reading this. Corn has one of the highest levels of polyphenols- antioxidants in fruits and vegetables that are considered protective against type 2 diabetes. One serving of air popped corn (3 cups) has twice the amount of polyphenols as a typical serving of fruit plus it will give you 2/3 of your daily recommended whole grain intake. Choose air-popped corn and avoid microwaved popcorn with added fake butter and chemical flavorings. Try garlic powder and Parmesan cheese, a little bit of olive oil, fresh herbs and salt, or a sprinkle of cinnamon. Corn comes in a variety of forms: sweet corn, grits, corn bread, tortillas, polenta, and corn chips. Enjoy whole grain corn bread, baked blue corn chips served with salsa, or a simple corn on the cob. When buying corn products look for ""whole"" or ""whole grain"" corn on the label.

Brown rice
Rice is the most commonly eaten grain worldwide. It is also gluten-free making it a healthy whole grain alternative for those with wheat allergies or Celiac disease. Similar to whole wheat, the process of refining it involves removing all or most of the bran, and some of the germ. In doing so, many important nutrients are lost, including insoluble fiber and magnesium, both of which have been shown to enhance blood sugar metabolism, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. Replacing white rice with brown rice will add more fiber to your diet. One cup of white rice only has around .5g of fiber, whereas a cup of brown rice has 3.5g. You can start by mixing white and brown rice together and slowly increase the ratio of brown rice. Brown rice a slightly nutty flavor and a small amount fills you fast!

Oats
Oats are a slowly-digested cereal that are almost always sold in their whole grain form. The water and fiber in cooked oatmeal leaves you feeling full and satisfied. Oats contain beta glucan, a type of soluble fiber that is especially effective at reducing the glycemic index (GI) of a meal. This special type of fiber also has the added benefit of reducing cholesterol. Finding whole grain oats is easy! If the ingredient list states ""oats"" or ""oatmeal"" you can rest assured that you're eating a whole grain. If you prefer instant oats, watch out for added sugar in the flavored varieties. Buy plain oatmeal and then add cinnamon, nutmeg, dried fruit, berries, or nuts to flavor it the way you like. Cook with a mixture of non-fat milk and coconut milk for a flavor boost.

Whole grains provide a powerful nutrient punch for people with diabetes. Compared to refined grains, they contain fiber, minerals, and antioxidants that will help you to regulate blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight.

Choose 100% whole grains at least 75% of the time. Swap out white bread, white rice, cakes, cookies, and the like with whole grain alternatives.";https://type2diabetes.com/nutrition/best-whole-grains-type-2-diabetes;grains made edible seeds kernels , whole form , contain three components—the endosperm , germ , bran . refined grains , found cakes , cookies , white bread , processed remove three components . whole grains contain components kernel making rich source fiber , nutrients , phytochemicals . whole grains effect type 2 diabetes management whole grains believed help prevent diabetes weight gain . researchers investigate links diet diabetes , one consistent findings people eat whole grains less likely develop disease . wheat far popular grain united states , third commonly eaten grain worldwide . breads , pastas , bulgur , couscous , spelt ( relative wheat ) many breakfast cereals derived wheat . eaten whole grain form , foods provide insoluble fiber phytochemicals shown improve insulin sensitivity . types whole grain read ingredients make sure says whole wheat ensure 100 % whole grain look whole grain symbol . corn snubbing corn starchy food place diabetes eating plan—you may reconsider reading . corn one highest levels polyphenols- antioxidants fruits vegetables considered protective type 2 diabetes . one serving air popped corn ( 3 cups ) twice amount polyphenols typical serving fruit plus give 2/3 daily recommended whole grain intake . choose air-popped corn avoid microwaved popcorn added fake butter chemical flavorings . try garlic powder parmesan cheese , little bit olive oil , fresh herbs salt , sprinkle cinnamon . corn comes variety forms : sweet corn , grits , corn bread , tortillas , polenta , corn chips . enjoy whole grain corn bread , baked blue corn chips served salsa , simple corn cob . buying corn products look `` whole '' `` whole grain '' corn label . brown rice rice commonly eaten grain worldwide . also gluten-free making healthy whole grain alternative wheat allergies celiac disease . similar whole wheat , process refining involves removing bran , germ . , many important nutrients lost , including insoluble fiber magnesium , shown enhance blood sugar metabolism , improve insulin sensitivity , decrease risk type 2 diabetes . replacing white rice brown rice add fiber diet . one cup white rice around .5g fiber , whereas cup brown rice 3.5g . start mixing white brown rice together slowly increase ratio brown rice . brown rice slightly nutty flavor small amount fills fast ! oats oats slowly-digested cereal almost always sold whole grain form . water fiber cooked oatmeal leaves feeling full satisfied . oats contain beta glucan , type soluble fiber especially effective reducing glycemic index ( gi ) meal . special type fiber also added benefit reducing cholesterol . finding whole grain oats easy ! ingredient list states `` oats '' `` oatmeal '' rest assured 're eating whole grain . prefer instant oats , watch added sugar flavored varieties . buy plain oatmeal add cinnamon , nutmeg , dried fruit , berries , nuts flavor way like . cook mixture non-fat milk coconut milk flavor boost . whole grains provide powerful nutrient punch people diabetes . compared refined grains , contain fiber , minerals , antioxidants help regulate blood sugar maintain healthy weight . choose 100 % whole grains least 75 % time . swap white bread , white rice , cakes , cookies , like whole grain alternatives .
"Abstract
Introduction: Plant-based dietary patterns that emphasize foods derived from plant sources and limit consumption of animal products have the potential to prevent and manage major chronic diseases. We aim to assess the existing prospective observational evidence on associations between adherence to plant-based dietary patterns and risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and mortality.

Methods: A s ystematic review and meta-analysis on prospective observational studies of plant-based dietary patterns and outcomes of T2D, CVD, cancer, and mortality was conducted. We searched PubMed and MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, and screened references.

Results: A total of 67 studies were identified, including 3,826,137 participants with 40,885 cases of incident T2D, 145,187 CVD cases, 25,510 cancer cases, and 75,412 deaths. An inverse association was observed between higher adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern and lower risks of T2D (RR, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.74-0.85]), CVD (0.89 [0.84-0.94]), and all-cause mortality (0.85 [0.76-0.95]) with a modest heterogeneity across studies (I2 ranged: 62.8%-96.2%), whereas a non-significant inverse association was observed for cancer risk (0.94 [0.87-1.01]; I2=49.2%). The inverse association with cancer was strengthened and became significant when healthy plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, were included in the definition of plant-based dietary patterns (0.90 [95% CI: 0.81-0.99; I2=41.0%]). Among seven studies with measurements of changes in dietary patterns, increased adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern was significantly associated with lower risks of T2D (0.82 [0.71-0.95]; I2=72.2%) and mortality (0.95 [0.91-1.00]; I2=0%).

Conclusions: Higher adherence to a plant-based dietary patterns, especially from healthy resources, may be beneficial for the primary prevention of T2D, CVD, cancer, and mortality.";https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.146.suppl_1.13268;"abstract introduction : plant-based dietary patterns emphasize foods derived plant sources limit consumption animal products potential prevent manage major chronic diseases . aim assess existing prospective observational evidence associations adherence plant-based dietary patterns risk developing type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) , cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , cancer , mortality . methods : ystematic review meta-analysis prospective observational studies plant-based dietary patterns outcomes t2d , cvd , cancer , mortality conducted . searched pubmed medline , embase , web science , screened references . results : total 67 studies identified , including 3,826,137 participants 40,885 cases incident t2d , 145,187 cvd cases , 25,510 cancer cases , 75,412 deaths . inverse association observed higher adherence plant-based dietary pattern lower risks t2d ( rr , 0.80 [ 95 % ci : 0.74-0.85 ] ) , cvd ( 0.89 [ 0.84-0.94 ] ) , all-cause mortality ( 0.85 [ 0.76-0.95 ] ) modest heterogeneity across studies ( i2 ranged : 62.8 % -96.2 % ) , whereas non-significant inverse association observed cancer risk ( 0.94 [ 0.87-1.01 ] ; i2=49.2 % ) . inverse association cancer strengthened became significant healthy plant-based foods , vegetables , fruits , whole grains , legumes , included definition plant-based dietary patterns ( 0.90 [ 95 % ci : 0.81-0.99 ; i2=41.0 % ] ) . among seven studies measurements changes dietary patterns , increased adherence plant-based dietary pattern significantly associated lower risks t2d ( 0.82 [ 0.71-0.95 ] ; i2=72.2 % ) mortality ( 0.95 [ 0.91-1.00 ] ; i2=0 % ) . conclusions : higher adherence plant-based dietary patterns , especially healthy resources , may beneficial primary prevention t2d , cvd , cancer , mortality ."
"Whether you've been newly diagnosed with diabetes or have been managing the condition for years, it can be tricky to plan meals that both optimize nutrition and keep your blood sugar in check. Navigating the latest nutrition news can also add another layer of confusion.

Here's what you need to know to feel confident in selecting and enjoying a variety of dairy foods in everyday meals and snacks.

Dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt are at the core of a healthy overall diet as per the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association. Aim to include at least 3 servings per day.
Dairy foods supply a nutrient package that includes essential vitamins and minerals. Three of theseâ€""calcium, vitamin D, and potassiumâ€""are important â€śshortfallâ€ť nutrients that many of us don't get enough of.
All dairy foods supply affordable, high-quality protein.
Pairing dairy foods with other nutritious choices helps maintain steady blood sugar levels.
When tracking your carbohydrate intake, remember that milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and cheese supply carbohydrates from a natural sugar called lactose. Be mindful of portion sizes and read food labels closely to limit added sugars so you can stay within your personal target carbohydrate range per meal or snack. Here are typical carbohydrate amounts for a serving of dairy.

Dairy and Prevention of Diabetes
Dairy foods also play a key role in the prevention of diabetes for those without the condition. A growing body of research connects the regular intake of at least 2 servings of dairy foods a day with multiple health benefits, including a lower risk for type 2 diabetes. The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans also recommend 3 servings of dairy foods per day for most individuals.

The Bottom Line: Is Dairy Good For Diabetics?
With the incidence of pre-diabetes and type 1 and type 2 diabetes on the rise for both children and adults, it's important to know how to take control and manage your personal risk or manage the condition to prevent irreversible long-term damage.

"Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research.

The latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful.

But exactly how big is the risk? And how much is too much?

Here's what you need to know.

What the study found:
Researchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study.

Over the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer.

They estimate:

Eating three rashers of bacon a day rather than just one could increase the risk of bowel cancer by 20%
For every 10,000 people in the study who ate 21g a day of red and processed meat, 40 were diagnosed with bowel cancer
The comparable figure for those who ate 76g a day, was 48
According to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak. A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat.

How much is too much?
It's not clear. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all.


According to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK, ""This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer,""

But she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year.

Public Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat.

And experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down.

The Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g.

Is eating some OK?
NHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks.

People can still eat meat and be healthy.

What makes it risky?
Processed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives.

It is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals.

When it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down.

But experts are still trying to fully understand the link.

What do experts say?
Prof Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer.

He said: ""The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

""The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings.

""The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit.""

Carrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: ""Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins.""

She said it was known that ""a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption"".";https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47947965;even small amounts red processed meat - rasher bacon day - increase risk bowel cancer , according research . latest study led oxford university funded cancer research uk , adds evidence , including world health organization , eating red meat harmful . exactly big risk ? much much ?

"Over the last few years, sugar's effect on our health has been well documented in a stream of damning research. The sweet stuff is now food enemy number one and is to blame for far more than hyperactive children and tooth decay.

With the World Health Organisation rewriting its recommendations for daily intake, you've possibly considered cutting back, but how do you kick the habit? Television presenter and fitness guru Davina McCall is keen to get the nation talking about sugar, and here she shares her personal tips for cutting back on sugar and her journey to becoming sugar-free.
We have plenty of guides to help you cut back on the sweet stuff. Check out 10 ways to manage sugar cravings, why is sugar bad for me? and will sugar make me old? Don't forget to browse our lower-sugar recipes for filling lunches, hearty dinners and sweet snacks that all contain less than 10g of sugar per serving.

Q. As of today, how long have you been sugar-free?
A. This time, I've been sugar-free for five months. I had given up sugar for a couple of years previously, but then when I did my Sport Relief challenge I started eating it again. I was doing an awful lot of exercise and had to eat a lot of sugar in the form of liquid gels and fast-releasing carbohydrates, such as rice and pasta, to keep my energy up. Really, for someone who is moderately active, carbs don't need to take up more than 10-20% of a meal, but my meals were about 70% carbs during that time.

Q. What was it that made you decide to give up sugar?
A. When my sister got cancer, the nutritionist told me that she should give up sugar and I found that quite telling. I did some research and realised I was a slave to it. We need a certain amount of carbohydrates, but we don't need added sugar. Stop eating it and you may stop mood swings, bad skin and weight gain.

Check out our helpful guide for all you need to know about sugar.

Q. Did sugar make you grumpy? (Facebook question from Rachael Scott)
A. Yeah, when I did it the first time cold turkey it made me very, very grumpy – I felt like I was grieving the loss of a loved one. I was more prepared this time round though, and have, for the most part, managed to taper off my sweet tooth.

Q. What does the term ‘sugar-free' mean to you?
A. Sugar-free to me means a diet free of refined sugar – things like processed foods and white flours, rice and bread. Packet sugar, too.

Q. Has quitting sugar changed the way you think about food?
A. I used to get stuck making the same 10 meals. There'd be a little variation, but I'd generally really struggle for inspiration – now I make all sorts of things!

Along the journey, I've also discovered some new ingredients that help balance my blood sugar levels and make my goal easier. Wholemeal spelt flour is one I couldn't be without – I used to think of it as being a faddy health food, but it's tasty, miles better for you than refined white flour and doesn't make you feel bloated. Also, spelt or barley make delicious alternatives to risotto rice.

Q. What health benefits did you notice after giving up sugar?
A. It definitely had an impact on my energy levels and my skin looks loads better. I also felt a sense of freedom and wasn't expecting that – I stopped feeling that I had to go to the fridge and scan for something sweet every evening. It took a while to get to that point, but was worth the wait.

Q. Your book is called 5 Weeks to Sugar-free – why five weeks?
A. I think it's a good amount of time – I don't know the science behind how long it takes for the craving to leave you, but I don't want people to be put off by going sugar-free too quickly. My book will slowly reduce the amount of refined sugars you eat. If you say to people 'you have to stop tomorrow', it's not realistic.

Q. What were the hardest times when you gave up sugar?
A. For me, 4pm was the worst time of day – I always used to have a lull about that time, especially when I worked in an office. Also about 9pm – after dinner I'd crave something sweet.

Q. How did you beat the cravings?
A. I'd have a piece of fruit and some plain nuts so I wasn't tempted to fall off the wagon. Just something to give me a sweet hit. As time goes by, those cravings don't happen anymore and it feels like being freed from the shackles of addiction.

Q. Do you think success is all in the preparation? (Facebook question from Ceri Morgan)
A. Definitely. You have to put strategies in place so when you're desperate and you would do anything for chocolate, you have something on hand.

Q. Do you avoid any fruits or natural sugars?
A. I do avoid grapes, but that's because they don't agree with me and give me a tummy ache. However, whole fruit is a great snack to have. I don't eat too many dried fruits as they're very sugary – I will have the odd raisin though.

Q. What alternatives do you use in baking? (Facebook question from Charlotte Davidson)
A. I just use maple syrup and honey in baking. These are classed as 'free' sugars so I do keep them to a minimum, but stevia is a useful option, too. I've replaced flour for wholemeal spelt in most of my bakes – you get the same results and it's a lovely taste.

Want to know more about stevia? Read our guide on this popular sugar substitute. Plus, we have a collection of delicious low-sugar baking recipes for you to try.

Q. What would be your ultimate tip for anyone thinking of going sugar-free?
A. The most important thing is not to beat yourself up if you slip – just pick it up again the next day. If you follow my plan, it should really help you; it's a good, balanced diet. Be realistic and make sure you have something sweet but free of refined sugars in the fridge in case you get a craving.

Q. Is there anyone you wouldn't recommend the lifestyle to?
A. Absolutely not – I think everyone can do it and it's a smart lifestyle choice. You have to want to do it for yourself though – I don't make my children go sugar-free because I think it's unrealistic for them. Reframe the idea: you're not giving up sugar, you're going to eat for better health. Affirm the fact you'll be giving yourself something rather than taking it away.

"If you want to make significant changes to your lifestyle for health reasons, reducing sugar intake is likely one of the first things that comes to mind. Sugar has been associated with numerous health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease, over the past few years. As a result, it is not surprising that the no-sugar diet-a diet that eliminates all added sugars and foods high in natural sugars-has recently gained popularity.

However, going sugar-free can be a difficult task, given that many scientists and experts denote sugar as one of the most addictive ingredients in the average modern diet.1 American adults consume an average of 60 pounds of added sugar a year2 -and that's because it's everywhere. ""Because there are over 50 different names given to sugars, it can make it even harder when reading food labels to determine what foods actually contain added sugar,"" explains nutritionist Emily Maguire.

While the primary (and most obvious) sources of sugar are sweetened beverages, desserts, foods containing high-fructose corn syrup, and sweets like candies, cookies, brownies, cakes, pies, and ice cream, these aren't the only culprits to look out for. Prepackaged salsa, canned soup, condiments, and bread, you name it-chances are, according to Maguire, they contain extra sugar, which means even the healthiest among us might not even be aware of how much sugar we consume daily.

To aid in your health journey, we asked Maguire, as well as licensed clinical psychologist and nutritionist Candice Seti, PsyD, and board-certified holistic health and nutrition practitioner Kimberly Spair, PhD-CCC-SLP/L, everything you need to know before attempting a low-sugar or no-sugar diet.

Keep reading for ideas on what to eat, plus tips for sticking with the plan.

MEET THE EXPERT

Candice Seti, PsyD, is a licensed clinical psychologist, nutritionist, and author based in San Diego, California.
Kimberly Spair, PhD-CCC-SLP/L, is a board-certified holistic health and nutrition practitioner.
Emily Maguire, MSc, BSc, is a UK-based nutritionist and the Strategy Director of Avalere Health. She specializes in the use of a low carbohydrate/ketogenic diet.
What Is a No-Sugar Diet?
The no-sugar diet is a diet that eliminates or limits all added sugars, foods high in natural sugars, and sugar substitutes. Stricter versions of the diet include eliminating foods with natural sugars, such as fruit, milk, and plain yogurt.

What Are The Benefits of a No-Sugar Diet?
There are numerous potential benefits of participating in a no-sugar or low-sugar diet, as excessive sugar consumption has been linked to the following:

Obesity
Diabetes
Heart disease
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Increased inflammation in the body
Adopting a no-sugar diet significantly decreases your risk for these health conditions.
What Can You Eat on a No-Sugar Diet?
Added sugar can be found in many products, but there are still plenty of options for food if you are looking to pursue a no-sugar diet. Some examples per Seti and Maguire include:

Chicken
Fish
Beef
Tofu
Eggs
Leafy greens
Nuts
Fruit
Dark Chocolate
Seeds
Olive oil
Avocado
Unsweetened yogurt
Carrots
Chickpeas
Beans
Quinoa
Sweet potatoes
Couscous
Sparkling water
Unsweetened beverages like coffee or tea
The beauty of this diet is that it has some allowances to keep you sane should cravings strike. While sugars and sweeteners of any kind-as well as refined grains and juices-may be limited or eliminated, you are permitted to have limited amounts of dark chocolate, fruit, whole grains, and even alcohol. For the best results, according to the experts, you'll want to moderate and indulge mindfully on those foods.

How to Follow a No-Sugar Diet
Plan and prepare
First things first: Clean out your pantry and fridge of any offending snacks or foods, because out of sight, out of mind(ish). Then your best strategy is to plan most of your meals. If you need some inspiration, there are so many websites and food blogs that specialize in recipes that are so tasty, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything-Minimalist Baker, Green Kitchen Stories, and Sprouted Kitchen are a few favorites.

""Look at the recipes and meal plans you want to follow, and get any ingredients you will need,"" advises Maguire. ""Remember the age-old saying, if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Look at your schedule for the coming week. Are you traveling a lot or have any dinners out? Plan by looking at the menu beforehand or have handy go-to sugar-free snacks. It'll make sticking with this all the easier.""

Once you hit the grocery store, the trickiest part is practicing a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to prepackaged or prepared foods. ""The hardest part of a sugar cleanse is avoiding all of the sneaky sugar hiding in even those most unsuspecting items, such as pasta sauce, dried fruit, juices, and yogurt,"" says Seti. ""Be sure to check the ingredient list on everything you buy.""

The first couple of days are the hardest
Because sugar is so addictive, you might even experience some withdrawal symptoms in addition to cravings. ""These symptoms usually occur in the first few days and can include headaches, stomach upset, irritability, and fatigue,"" says Seti. ""They will pass, so stick with it!""

Be ready for cravings and withdrawal symptoms
Maguire adds that in cases of extreme cravings, your best strategy is to allow your body to indulge-a healthy, non-restrictive way. ""The body is looking to satisfy the reward center in the brain,"" she explains. ""If you find that any craving hits, then reaching for good low-sugar snacks such as dark chocolate (above 70% cocoa), nut butter, nuts and seeds, or berries with Greek yogurt can kill the cravings.""

Byrdie Tip

Incorporate foods and beverages that are bitter into your diet to help reset your taste buds and fight cravings.3?

Drink lots of water
""A helpful tip while adjusting to a sugar cleanse is to drink a large amount of water throughout the day,"" says Seti. ""Water will help balance your blood sugar, keep your system running effectively, and minimize the impact of any withdrawal symptoms.""

Eat a lot of protein and fiber
""Many might experience sugar cravings as the brain seeks glucose,"" according to Spair. To keep your blood sugar balanced, protein is the category of food you want to focus on, with fiber coming in a close second. Those foods will curb your cravings and keep your energy up.4 Stock up on lean meats and fish, as well as nuts and seeds to munch on when cravings hit between meals. Broccoli is high in both, and so is edamame. Avocados are high in fiber and fat.5 The key is to know which foods you should load up on and which you should avoid. Knowing what you intend to eat beforehand will make things much easier when making decisions on the fly.

Avoid trying to ""replace"" your day-to-day foods
Don't expect that you'll be able to eat the sugar-free versions of things you like, or replace sugar-filled coffee with tea, and just go on like everything is the same. You're making a significant alteration-don't fight it.

Give yourself room to breathe
It's easy to press yourself, expecting that you'll be able to perform at the same level you were beforehand while you're detoxing. But you can follow all of the right steps to mitigate the side effects and still experience them.

Stress can actually cause you to crave sugary, easy-to-eat foods.6 Exercising will mitigate some stress, but you are going through a form of withdrawal and will likely feel cloudy.7 Try to avoid situations in which you need to perform at your peak at least for the first couple of days, and instead focus on taking care of yourself physically and mentally. This includes not being too hard on yourself if you break and have a piece of dark chocolate.

Mind over matter
""The most important thing when doing a sugar cleanse is to take it one day at a time,"" says Seti. ""Simply focus on getting through the day ahead of you before focusing on the next. Each day's success will build on the one before it. And if you struggle or don't succeed immediately, each day represents an opportunity to try again."" In other words, if you slip, don't sweat it. The fact that you're even trying is an accomplishment in itself.

And if you're ever waning on motivation, think back to your initial goals-even write them down so you have the constant reminder. ""Maybe you are looking to lose weight, improve your skin, or stop mood cycling,"" says Maguire. ""Whatever the reason, figuring out your goals will help you through this challenge. Anytime you feel like stopping or giving up, come back to why you started this in the first place, and it will give you the motivation to keep going or continue beyond your original timeline.""

Think of your goals
The best news is that after you get over the hump of those first tough couple of days, you'll be amazed by how energized and how great you feel-your mood will start to regulate, you'll sleep better,8? and you might even see some improvements in your skin and body. Be mindful and observant of the good, because it will power you right through the end (and perhaps beyond).

Try and keep with it
After any detox, the worst thing you can do for your body is overload on the thing you were detoxing from the second you're ""allowed"" to. Instead, celebrate with some dark chocolate, bread and cheese, or a little wine-something sugary that isn't a piece of cake. Slowly integrate sugar back into your diet (if you want to at all); it'll be a shock your system if you eat too much so soon. Plus, you might not have as much of a taste for sugar anyway.

Potentials Risks
While there are no known health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive diets can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. It's important to ensure you're still getting enough calories daily from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

"Dairy foods
Dairy foods such as milk, yoghurt and cheese are a rich source of nutrients. They provide an excellent source of calcium and contain protein, vitamin and minerals.

What about the risk of dairy and cancer?
In terms of cancer risk, the current scientific evidence regarding dairy foods is inconclusive.

Milk probably decreases the risk of colorectal (bowel) cancer, and there is limited suggestive evidence suggesting that it can also reduce the risk of bladder cancer.

However, diets high in calcium are classed as a probable cause of prostate cancer, and in addition there is also limited suggestive evidence that a high intake of dairy products is also a cause of prostate cancer.

Should I eat dairy foods?
The current evidence that dairy products can protect against cancer or increase the risk of cancer is not conclusive. Cancer Council supports that the proven health benefits of dairy foods outweigh the unproven harms.

Dairy foods should be eaten as part of a varied and nutritious diet. Cancer Council supports the Australian Dietary Guidelines, which encourage adults to eat at least two and a half serves of dairy foods (milk, cheese and yoghurt) each day and to choose reduced fat varieties of dairy foods where possible.



What is a serve of dairy? 
One serve of dairy equals:

1 cup (250mls) milk (fresh, UHT, long life or reconstituted powdered)
? cup evaporated unsweetened milk
200g yoghurt
40g cheese (roughly the size of a matchbox).
Practical and healthy ways to consume dairy foods include:

a milkshake made with skim milk and fresh banana or berries
low fat vanilla yoghurt with some passionfruit or natural muesli
a low fat yoghurt dip with vegetable sticks as a snack
a fruit salad topped with some low fat natural yoghurt
bake potatoes in the oven and stuff them with vegetables and grated low-fat tasty cheese
low fat cream cheese as a spread on sandwiches instead of butter
low fat natural yoghurt with chopped mint or coriander as an accompaniment to lamb or Indian flavoured dishes
shaved parmesan cheese over the top of pasta dishes and risottos

"What is a wholegrain?
Grains are the seeds of cereal plants.

Wholegrains and wholegrain products are made from the entire grain. Refined (processed) grains are missing part of the grain. This creates the whiter grains seen in white bread, white rice, and white pasta.

Most of the nutrients and fibre are found in these removed parts. This means that wholegrains are naturally more nutritious and are higher in fibre than refined grains. Wholegrains are things like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, oats and wholegrain bread.

What is fibre?
Fibre is a type of carbohydrate (carb) that doesn't easily break down, it moves through our gut into the bowel.  Fibre is found in plant-based foods like wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and pulses (such as beans or lentils).

Based on what we know so far, it seems the fibre from wholegrains is better at reducing cancer risk than fibre from other foods, such as fruits and vegetables. But it's important to eat a variety of high-fibre foods as part of a healthy balanced diet.

 

How can I eat more fibre and wholegrains?
Having a diet high in fibre, and wholegrains in particular, can help to reduce your risk of cancer.

For more fibre and wholegrains try:

Switching everyday foods such as bread, pasta or rice to their wholegrain or brown alternative.
 
Starting with a high-fibre breakfast. Swap processed cereals for wholegrain versions like shredded whole wheat and bran cereals, or porridge oats.
 
Having fruit and vegetables with every meal (they can be fresh, frozen or tinned).
 
Eating the skin on veg such potatoes and carrots. This helps get the most fibre from your food.
 
Using pulses such as lentils or beans in the place of some or all the meat in your favourite dishes. Check out our blog for more ideas.
 
Adding in wholegrain or high-fibre snacks such as plain popcorn, fruit, nuts and seeds or whole wheat crackers.
 

How much fibre and wholegrains should I have?
The government recommends that adults have 30g of fibre each day. For most people, this means eating more portions of wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal toast (7g of fibre), wholegrain cereals (13-24.5g of fibre) and whole wheat pasta (4.2g of fibre).

Many products have labels showing how much fibre is in them. High-fibre products have 6g or more fibre per 100g.

When looking for wholegrains check for the word 'whole' before the name of the grain or product name, for example, 'whole wheat pasta' or 'wholemeal bread'. Remember, all oats and brown rice are wholegrains.

How can fibre reduce bowel cancer risk?
There are several ways that a high-fibre diet could reduce your risk of bowel cancer.

Fibre helps us to poo more often, increases the size of poos and dilutes their contents. This means harmful chemicals spend less time in the bowel.

When fibre meets the bacteria in the bowel, the bacteria make something called butyrate. Butyrate helps the cells in our bowel to stay healthy, so that tumours are less likely to develop.

Eating more fibre can also help you keep a healthy weight by feeling fuller for longer. Being a healthy weight not only cuts the risk of bowel cancer, but 12 other cancers too.

 
Should I take fibre supplements?
Fibre supplements may be useful for some people with certain medical conditions. But for most of us the best way to have more fibre is by making changes to our diet and eating more high-fibre foods, particularly wholegrains. The evidence so far has looked at the health benefits of fibre in what we eat, rather than in supplements.";https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/wholegrains-fibre-and-cancer-risk;wholegrain ? grains seeds cereal plants . wholegrains wholegrain products made entire grain . refined ( processed ) grains missing part grain . creates whiter grains seen white bread , white rice , white pasta . nutrients fibre found removed parts . means wholegrains naturally nutritious higher fibre refined grains . wholegrains things like brown rice , whole wheat pasta , oats wholegrain bread . fibre ? fibre type carbohydrate ( carb ) n't easily break , moves gut bowel . fibre found plant-based foods like wholegrains , fruit , vegetables pulses ( beans lentils ) . based know far , seems fibre wholegrains better reducing cancer risk fibre foods , fruits vegetables .

"From brie to cheddar, cheese can be shredded on top of a salad or eaten alongside fruit and crackers. But is it healthy?

The short answer is yes, cheese can be part of a healthy diet. There are lots of different kinds of cheeses with ranging health benefits.

Here's a closer look at the benefits of cheese and some recipes that incorporate different kinds of cheese.

What is cheese?
At a basic level, cheese is a solid dairy product made from milk. Ancient cultures discovered cheese when they left milk out in the sun and it curdled, according to Harvard Health Publishing. Salt and other additives can change the flavor of cheese.

The art of cheesemaking has been around for thousands of years across different cultures. Ancient Egyptian tomb murals depict cheese and cheesemaking, per the National Historic Cheesemaking Center. There is no agreed upon origin story of the making of cheese, but it's believed sheep's milk was used for cheese early on.

Is cheese healthy?
Cheese can be healthy in moderation.

It's a calorie-dense food, which means it has a lot of calories in small portions. It also is high in fat (saturated fat), which means it's important to watch portions. Cheese has a high content of vitamin K2, according to a study published in Frontiers in Nutrition. Researchers said it was ""a neutral food that fits a healthy diet.""

Cheese also has health benefits like protein, vitamin B12, zinc, calcium and vitamin D, according to WebMD. What the nutrients in cheese can mean for you are better bone and muscle health, less inflammation (and may be even beneficial for preventing heart disease and obesity), lower blood pressure, blood vessel protection and gut health.

Moderate consumption of some cheeses in conjunction to fruits, vegetables, milk and bread has been found to contribute to longevity of life. A study published in Nature that followed populations from three French areas for around 15 years found that ""moderate consumptions of yogurts and cottage cheese, other cheeses"" was associated with a lower risk of death.

What's the healthiest kind of cheese?
Here are nine of the healthiest kinds of cheese you can eat, according to Healthline.

Mozzarella.
Feta.
Cottage cheese.
Blue cheese.
Cheddar.
Goat cheese.
Ricotta.
Parmesan.
Swiss.
Some principles for choosing healthy cheese are:

Look for a lower fat and lower sodium cheese. Mozzarella is an example of a cheese with lower sodium and fat compared to other types of cheeses, and given its mild flavor, it can be used in a variety of different dishes.
When eating a hard cheese like Parmesan, remember the high sodium content and be mindful of the portion size. The good news is Parmesan has a distinctive flavor, so a little bit of it can add big taste to a dish.
If you pick up cheddar cheese or another high-protein and high-fat cheese, it's important to watch the portion size, because there's typically a high amount of saturated fat.
While all cheese is processed (it is processed from milk into cheese), some cheese is more processed than others, per Today. Limiting processed cheeses like American cheese or canned spray cheese may be a healthier choice.

What are healthy ways to eat cheese?
Sprinkle some feta or shredded mozzarella on top of a salad loaded with vegetables. You can use olive oil and vinegar for a simple dressing that allows the flavor of the cheese to stand out.
Think of cheese as an accent to help increase your vegetable intake. Melting a little bit of cheese across some broccoli or asparagus can be a good way to up your vegetable intake.
Pair an ounce of cheese with berries for dessert. While cheese isn't always thought of as a dessert food, brie or mascarpone go well with berries and can be part of a satiating dessert that may make the berries more satisfying.
Shred some cheese into scrambled eggs with vegetables for a healthy breakfast.
If you're craving a cheesy pizza, try halving the amount of cheese you would usually put on the pizza and adding vegetables and lean protein for a satiating slice.
Swap out a higher-calorie cheese for a lower-calorie cheese in a dish. Instead of eating baked ziti with higher-fat cheeses, try using cottage cheese or another lower-calorie cheese. You can still use a higher-fat cheese in the dish by sprinkling it on top.

"When it comes to your diet, you probably already know you need to eat less saturated fat, salt and sugar and at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. But did you know that wholegrains should also feature? As a nation, we are not eating enough of them.

What are wholegrains?
Wholegrains are the seeds of cereal plants such as wheat, maize, corn, rye, barley, oats, rice and quinoa. In their natural unprocessed state, grains consist of three parts:

the endosperm
the bran
the germ
The endosperm is the central part of the grain and is a concentrated source of starch. The outer most layer, the bran, is a rich source of insoluble dietary fibre, B vitamins and phytochemicals. The germ is a concentrated source of protein, 'healthy' fats, B vitamins and vitamin E.

When wholegrains are refined, for instance to make white flour, most of the bran and germ are removed and with it most of the nutrients, dietary fibre and other protective components, which are concentrated in the bran and germ layers.

Wholegrain foods, retain all three parts of the grain. They may be eaten whole (eg brown rice and oats), cracked (eg bulgur wheat), or milled into flour and made into foods like bread and pasta. To qualify as a wholegrain, a food must contain 51 per cent or more wholegrain ingredients by weight per serving.

Why are wholegrains a healthy choice?
Wholegrains are a smart choice, not just for people with diabetes, but for the whole family. If you do have diabetes, wholegrain foods are usually better for managing blood glucose levels because they tend to have a lower glycaemic index (GI). This means they do not affect blood glucose levels as quickly as refined carbohydrate foods. However, since wholegrains are also carbohydrate foods, and all carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels, be mindful of your portion sizes.

Some studies have shown that healthy diets, rich in wholegrain foods, can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, certain types of cancer and Type 2 diabetes. The ways in which wholegrains help prevent these conditions are not fully understood. They can play a part in maintaining a healthy body weight over time as part of a healthy, balanced diet and help keep your gut healthy due to the compounds they contain called phytochemicals. Studies also suggest that wholegrain foods may be more filling than their refined counterparts, which may help reduce the urge for snacking between meals and help people manage their weight.

How much should we eat?
In the UK there are no official recommendations, but most experts recommend at least three servings a day. It's important to replace refined products with wholegrain foods to help keep your blood glucose and weight in check in the long term.

1 serving of whole grains equals:

25g porridge oats
1 bowl (34g) muesli
1 bowl (30g) toasted wholegrain oat cereal
1 bowl of wheat-based breakfast cereal
1 bowl of breakfast cereal made from wholewheat
1 large slice (40g) multi-grain bread
23g (uncooked weight) brown rice
23g (uncooked weight) wholewheat pasta
3 Ryvitas
3 oatcakes
1 slice of rye bread
1 wholemeal pitta bread
Are there gluten-free wholegrains?
If you follow a gluten-free diet there are plenty of gluten-free wholegrains that you can enjoy such as brown rice, quinoa, uncontaminated oats, millet, sorghum, teff and buckwheat.

What's the difference between wholemeal, wholewheat, wholegrain and granary bread?
Wholemeal, wholewheat and wholegrain bread are basically different terms for the same thing and all are wholegrain. However, granary bread is slightly different and refers to bread that contains malted wheat flakes that are added to give it a characteristic texture. This may or may not be made from wholemeal flour, so you will need to check the label. Wheat-germ bread is made from white flour to which a portion of wheat germ has been added back, it is not wholegrain.

How to eat more wholegrains
There are plenty of simple and tasty ways to introduce wholegrains into your diet.

Choose a wholegrain cereal for breakfast.
Swap white bread for wholemeal bread – look for the words 'wholegrain' or 'wholemeal' on the label.
Choose brown rice instead of white – look out for brown basmati and quick-cook brown rice.
Use wholemeal flour for baking – if you're not used to baking with wholemeal flour start by substituting half the white flour with wholemeal. As you get used to cooking with wholemeal flour you can gradually increase the proportion.
Choose oatcakes or Ryvita or wholemeal crackers instead of cream crackers.
Swap couscous for bulgur wheat.
Add barley to soups and stews.
Popcorn is a wholegrain so as a treat swap crisps or other savoury for unsalted sugar-free popcorn.
Corn on the cob is wholegrain, or you can add sweetcorn to recipes like spaghetti bolognese or chilli con carne.

"Not all grains are created equal, so it's important to choose the ones that are going to add the most benefit to your diabetes meal plan. Here's the whole truth about whole grains and diabetes, plus some compelling reasons why you should opt for whole grain foods whenever possible.

What are whole grains?  
Unlike refined grains, whole grains contain all parts of their seed (bran, endosperm and germ) to retain the most nutrients. The outer layer (or bran) provides the most fibre, while the germ provides good amounts of B and E vitamins. The endosperm contains carbohydrates and protein, plus other vitamins and minerals.

Refined grains, on the other hand, have had their germ and bran removed (e.g., white flour, white rice, cream of wheat) resulting in a loss of fibre, along with fewer vitamins and minerals. Some refined grains are enriched with vitamins and minerals, but they're still lacking all the nutrients found in whole grains.

What is the difference between whole grains and whole wheat?
Just because a food is promoted as whole wheat or multi-grain, doesn't mean it is whole grain. In Canada, for example, whole wheat flour has had most of its germ and some of its bran removed, so that 100% whole wheat bread is definitely not whole grain. (Whole wheat bread is still more nutritious than white bread, mind you.)

Some foods may look like they're whole grain—caramel colouring is sometimes added to bread to make it look darker, for example—so it's important to read the ingredient list. For whole wheat flour to be considered whole grain, its ingredient list should contain words such as ""whole grain whole wheat"" or ""whole wheat flour with added germ"". When choosing whole grain products, make sure whole grains appear first on the ingredient list, too (e.g., whole barley or whole rye). Don't be fooled by products listed as 'multi-grain' either. Even though they include a variety of grains, these may not be whole grains.

When shopping for whole grain foods, try and look for healthier, higher-fibre options whenever possible. A ""high fibre"" food contains at least 4 grams of fibre per serving.

Why should whole grains be included in a diabetes diet?  
Whole grain foods contain essential vitamins, minerals and fibre. That's why Canada's Food Guide recommends we eat whole grains as part of a healthy diet. Research also shows that eating foods higher in fibre can help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as help in reducing your risk of some cancers and stroke. The fibre in whole-grain foods also help us in maintaining regular bowel movements.

How do whole grains affect blood sugar levels?
Research has shown that choosing whole grains over refined grains can help you achieve optimal blood sugar levels and reduce insulin sensitivity. Choosing rolled oats instead of refined instant oatmeal, for example, releases a slower and steadier rate of sugar into your blood. Highly refined grains will release that sugar much more quickly, resulting in spikes in your blood sugar levels.

What are some examples of whole grains?
Here are some tasty whole grains to try in future meals:

brown and wild rice
whole oats
buckwheat
rye
quinoa
bulgur
corn (including popcorn)
farro
freekeh
amaranth
millet
whole grain or pot barley*
*NOTE: Although pearl barley is technically a re?ned grain, it's much healthier than other re?ned grains because some of the bran may still be present. Also, the ?bre in barley is distributed throughout the kernel, and not just in the outer bran layer. Pearl barley is still a healthy choice, but is not a whole grain.

How do I incorporate more whole grain foods into my diabetes meal plan?
There are plenty of delicious ways to add more whole grain foods to your eating options. Here are several examples:

Start your day with whole grain cereal, oatmeal or whole grain toast
Try adding a whole grain you've never tried before (e.g., farro, buckwheat or freekeh) to your meal planning every week
Stock your pantry with whole grain foods such as oats, brown rice, quinoa and whole grain pasta to use in a pinch
Substitute white rice with brown, or whole grain pasta for your regular variety
Add barley, quinoa or bulgur to your next soup or salad
Try millet or barley as a side dish instead of rice
Snack on whole grain crackers and hummus or another healthy dip
Search up recipes using whole grains to add to your weekly roster of meals

Here's more information on how to cook quinoa and millet and a recipe for whole grain fruit and granola to try.

Here are some tips to ensure a recipe is, in fact, a healthy choice for you when you have diabetes.

Keep in mind that whole grains generally have a shorter shelf-life than their refined counterparts. Be sure to store them in the fridge or freezer to keep them staying fresh longer.

"Fish are a lean, healthy source of protein-and the oily kinds, such as salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel, deliver those heart- and brain-healthy omega-3 fats. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults eat 8 ounces of seafood per week (based on a 2,000-calorie diet).

There's also concern about the environment-and choosing seafood that's sustainable. So, if you often stand at the fish counter a little perplexed and wondering what's good for yourself and the planet, we can help. We've done research to find the healthiest fish to eat when it comes to sustainability, mercury content and nutritional benefits.
5 of the Healthiest Fish to Eat
1. Atlantic Mackerel
This species is a fast-growing fish, meaning it can repopulate easily and handle higher amounts of fishing. The gear used to catch types of Atlantic mackerel is efficient and not likely to cause major habitat destruction, another reason this guy is an ocean-friendly choice. This strong-flavored fish is high in heart-healthy omega-3s, a good source of protein-delivering about 20 grams in 3 ounces cooked-and pairs well with bold seasonings.

2. Salmon, Wild-Caught (including canned)
Most farmed-raised and wild-caught salmon is relatively low in mercury and other contaminants. Even better, a 2023 Science of the Total Environment article concluded that wild-caught Alaska salmon produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than farmed Norwegian salmon, making it better for the environment.

To give you an idea of how well-managed Alaska's salmon fisheries are, consider this: Biologists are posted at river mouths to count how many wild fish return to spawn. If the numbers begin to dwindle, the fishery is closed before it reaches its limits, as was done recently with some Chinook fisheries. This close monitoring, along with strict quotas and careful management of water quality, means Alaska's wild-caught salmon are more sustainable than just about any other salmon fishery.

From a nutrition standpoint, farmed-raised and wild-caught salmon have just about the same heart-healthy omega-3 fats, according to the USDA. Buying salmon in a can is a more affordable way to get this healthy seafood in your diet. Canned salmon is not just a great source of omega-3 fats, it is one of the best sources of nondairy calcium. A 3-ounce serving has 241 milligrams (most adults need between 1,000 to 1,200 mg per day). Canned wild salmon is typically sockeye or pink from Alaska, but you'll want to check the label to make sure.

3. Sardines, Wild-Caught (including canned)
The tiny, inexpensive sardine is making it onto many lists of superfoods, and for good reason. It packs nearly 300 mg of omega-3 fats per 3 ounces and is one of the very few foods that's naturally high in vitamin D. It's also one of the few foods naturally high in calcium, packing 25% of your daily needs per serving. Other fish, like herring, pilchards and sprat, are in the same family as sardines.

Quick to reproduce, Pacific sardines have rebounded from both overfishing and a natural collapse in the 1940s. Get a taste for sardines in our delicious Lemon-Garlic Sardine Fettuccine that even sardine skeptics might enjoy.

4. Rainbow Trout (and some types of Lake)
Rainbow trout (also referred to as steelhead trout), is one of the best fish to eat when it's farmed in the U.S. or in indoor recirculating tanks, according to Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Trout ranks just under canned pink salmon when it comes to omega-3 fats and supplies potassium, selenium and vitamin B6 while offering more than a day's worth of vitamin B12.

Lake trout is a great alternative when it's sourced from the right places. Seafood Watch advises buying lake trout caught in the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Superior's Michigan and Minnesota waters, while avoiding trout that was caught from Wisconsin's Lake Superior waters.

5. Herring
Herring is a Nordic Diet staple-it has a higher omega-3 content than sardines, trout and mackerel at more than 1,400 mg per 3 ounces. It's also an excellent source of vitamin D and selenium. You'll typically find herring that has been canned, cured or smoked on restaurant menus, but it can also be eaten fresh.

Seafood Watch recommends buying U.S. Atlantic herring caught with purse seines or California herring caught with set gill nets. Befriend your local fishmonger, they will help you figure out the sourcing methods for your desired fish.

5 Fish to Limit
A number of environmental organizations have advocated taking several fish off the menu. The large fish listed below are just five examples EatingWell chose to highlight: popular fish that are both depleted and, in many cases, carry higher levels of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Mercury and PCBs are referred to as ""legacy pollutants"" and have been found to cause serious health issues in humans. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has also posted health advisories on some of these fish.

1. Bluefin Tuna
The World Wildlife Fund put the bluefin tuna on its list of endangered species, and Seafood Watch warns their populations are depleted and overfished. Bluefin has high levels of mercury and can be high in PCBs, so EDF recommends eating no more than 1 serving per month of this fish.

2. Orange Roughy
This fish lives a long life but is slow to reproduce, making it vulnerable to overfishing. The EDF explains that orange roughy have extremely long lives, up to 149 years in some cases. This also means the fish have high levels of mercury, causing EDF to issue a health advisory.

3. Salmon, Farmed in Pens (Atlantic)
Most farmed salmon are raised in tightly packed, open-net pens often rife with parasites and diseases that threaten the wild salmon trying to swim by to their ancestral spawning waters. Open-net-farmed salmon are often given antibiotics to combat diseases, and their food and waste pollute the ocean. Freshwater-farmed salmon have earned a ""Best Choice"" status from Seafood Watch and some open-net systems are rated as ""Good Alternatives."" There is hope that consumer pressure will encourage more farms to continue to adopt better practices.

4. Mahi-Mahi (Costa Rica, Guatemala & Peru)
Imported, longline mahi-mahi, or dolphinfish, is rated as one of the least eco-friendly fish by the Environmental Defense Fund. There is concern about bycatch, including sea turtles, seabirds and sharks, getting tangled in the fishing gear when mahi-mahi is fished. However, mahi-mahi caught in the U.S. and Ecuador with troll lines is ranked under ""Good Alternative"" by Seafood Watch and is the better choice if you're hankering for this particular fish.

5. Halibut, Wild-Caught (Atlantic)
This fish grows and matures slowly (living as long as 50 years), so it is susceptible to overfishing. Consequently, because of the depletion of Atlantic halibut populations, the U.S. prohibits commercial harvest of this breed, found in the North Atlantic Ocean, and Seafood Watch rates it ""Avoid."" Pacific halibut is a good alternative, as it comes from well-managed fisheries with little habitat damage and low rates of other marine life being caught as bycatch.";https://www.eatingwell.com/article/69763/5-of-the-healthiest-fish-to-eat-and-5-to-avoid/;fish lean , healthy source protein-and oily kinds , salmon , tuna , sardines mackerel , deliver heart- brain-healthy omega-3 fats . dietary guidelines americans recommends adults eat 8 ounces seafood per week ( based 2,000-calorie diet ) .

"Men who chug milk - or even sip a little - every day would be smart to cut back or even eliminate it from their diets. That's because several recent studies conclude that milk, though not necessarily other dairy products, may put them at higher risk for prostate cancer.

An article published in 2023 in the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention reviewed several large studies linking cancer to dairy consumption and pointed to two possible reasons why milk may increase prostate cancer risk: estrogen and something called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which are hormones produced naturally in cow's milk.

""IGF-1 is a growth hormone, and growth hormones can cause cancers to grow,"" says Anna Herby, DHSc, RD, nutrition education program manager for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) and corresponding author of the review article.

One of the studies that were reviewed followed nearly 22,000 men for almost three decades, and determined that those who consumed 2.5 servings of dairy daily had a 34 percent higher risk of developing prostate cancer compared with men who consumed half a serving or less. One surprising finding: The study found that low-fat and skim milk brought a higher risk of prostate cancer than regular or high fat milk. Dr. Herby says that may be due to estrogen's ability to ""bind"" with more watery products (like skim milk).

Even a Small Amount of Milk May Increase Prostate Cancer Risk
Merely cutting back on milk might not be enough to reduce your risk: A recent study found that even a little milk in your coffee every day could boost your risk of prostate cancer. The results were published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Researchers at Loma Linda University followed the health and self-reported dietary habits of nearly 30,000 men in the United States and Canada over a five-year period. They compared their data with state cancer statistics and concluded that men who consumed 430 grams of dairy per day (about 1 ? cups of milk) had a 25 percent higher risk of prostate cancer compared with men who consumed 20 grams of dairy per day (about a tablespoon of milk).

What's more concerning is that even a very small amount of milk may increase prostate cancer risk, according to Gary Fraser, MBChB, PhD, the study's principal investigator and distinguished professor at Loma Linda University School of Medicine and School of Public Health in California.

""The lowest risk of cancer is [seen with] close to zero milk consumption, and the risk increases dramatically up to about three-quarters of a cup of milk a day. But above that level, the risk doesn't continue to increase,"" he says.

Dr. Fraser cautions that pinpointing the exact risk of cancer from milk, or any food, is challenging because people self-report - and misreport - their consumption, and because there are so many other factors (such as overall diet and lifestyle) that can increase or reduce risk. Still, he believes milk is a real concern for men.

""Our study and a number of other studies raise a very serious question as to whether dairy and milk consumption is related to prostate cancer, and a prudent person may seriously consider reducing consumption or eliminating milk from their diet,"" he says.

Many Factors Affect Prostate Cancer Risk
Diet is just one risk factor for prostate cancer, and having one or more risk factor does not mean you're likely to get cancer. Top risk factors for prostate cancer include but are not limited to:

Age Prostate cancer mainly affects older men. The risk rises after age 50, with about 6 in 10 prostate cancers discovered in men over 65. Testicular cancer, however, is mostly a disease of young and middle-aged men, according to the American Cancer Society, with only 8 percent occurring in men over age 55.
Race and Ethnicity While it's not clear why, men of African and Caribbean descent have a much higher incidence of prostate cancer than non-Hispanic white men, while Asian and Latino men have a lower incidence of prostate cancer than non-Hispanic white men.
Genetics Although men with a family history of prostate cancer account for a minority of prostate cancer cases, having a father or brother with prostate cancer significantly increases a man's chances of developing it, according to the American Cancer Society. Men with the relatively rare BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition, also have an increased risk for several types of cancer, including prostate cancer.
Alternative Sources of Calcium
Should men worry about a higher risk of prostate cancer if they consumed a lot of milk as a child? The answer to that question is unclear, as any study attempting to investigate that would have to follow males for 50 years or more (remember, prostate cancer usually shows up in older men). Herby says that parents who worry about a child's risk of developing prostate cancer much later in life might want to think twice about giving them cow's milk.

""Children can live without dairy, and there are many nondairy products that provide a good source of calcium, including almond milk,"" she says. ""And soy milk, a good source of calcium, has been found to be protective against some types of cancer.""

Herby also points to the growing body of research showing that a plant-based, vegan diet (no animal products and no dairy) can further reduce the risk of prostate cancer and other cancers. ""We can always use more data on how a fully plant-based diet can reduce the risk of all types of cancer, but I can say avoiding dairy is a good way to go,"" she says.

Nondairy sources of calcium (including nonvegan foods) include:

Canned salmon and sardines, with the bones
Tofu
Soybeans and soy milk
Spinach, turnip greens, and kale
Broccoli
Fortified orange juice
Sweet potatoes

"If you've been considering adding dairy to your diabetes meal plan, you've probably noticed some conflicting advice on whether you should go with low-fat options or full-fat varieties. Even within the nutrition world, there's debate over what's most beneficial for individuals with diabetes.

The recently released 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, jointly published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), recommend including dairy sources such as milk, yogurt, and cheese regularly in the diet, though they stress that these sources should be fat-free or low-fat. But are these recommendations best for those with diabetes? We decided to ask some of the nation's top diabetes experts to find out.

Although experts may differ on the recommendations for fat content of dairy, most agree that incorporating some form of dairy on a regular basis may be beneficial for diabetes management.

Dairy and Its Role in Diabetes Management
""In my counseling sessions, I recommend dairy in general,"" explains Toby Smithson, RDN, CDE, author of Diabetes Meal Planning and Nutrition for Dummies, who is based in Hilton Head, South Carolina. She points out that ""two out of every three people with diabetes have high blood pressure, which may be reduced by eating foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Dairy foods contain all three of these substances.""

Consuming dairy may not help not only with diabetes management, but also with preventing the development of the disease. Data from the Nurses Health Study II appeared in an article published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that suggested diets rich in dairy may have a protective effect against the development of type 2 diabetes. ""High dairy intake is associated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, especially when started at an early age of adolescence,"" explains Smithson. A review of research published in September 2017 in the journal Nutrients concluded that the consumption of dairy and dairy products offers protective benefits against type 2 diabetes. 

As the research indicates, including dairy as part of a well-balanced diet can be beneficial at preventing and managing diabetes, but the question remains as to what type of dairy is the best choice. ""There is emerging research that full-fat dairy may have a protective effect on preventing type 2 diabetes, yet that research is not conclusive and does not necessarily apply once diabetes has already developed,"" explains Lori Zanini, RD, CDE, creator of For The Love of Diabetes, who is based in Los Angeles.

For those at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, consuming full-fat dairy warrants some consideration, especially when it comes to weight management. A study published in February 2016 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at the role of full-fat diary on weight management over the span of almost two decades. Women consuming more than 3.1 servings of full-fat dairy per day showed the lowest amount of weight gain.

The most likely explanation for such findings may be due to the impact fat has on hunger and satiety. ""Fat-free products do not promote the same levels of satiety as their fat-containing versions, since fat takes longer to digest,"" explains Zanini. Although full-fat dairy products may be more filling, they are typically richer in calories as well. ""I don't encourage my clients with diabetes to consume full-fat dairy exclusively as this is often a source of excess calories,"" explains Zanini, adding, ""the excess fat in the diet can also interfere with the insulin response.""

Diabetes and Dairy: No One-Size-Fits-All Recommendation
Providing a standard recommendation on dairy for people with diabetes can be challenging. Depending on the individual's health needs and goals, the best form of dairy will vary. ""I typically encourage low-fat versions, but also promote variety and honoring the personal preference of the client,"" adds Zanini. ""I recommend 2 percent Greek yogurt if using in baking, but 0 percent if eating daily for breakfast."" 

For Smithson, dairy recommendations are also individualized. ""I recommend dairy based on my client's preferences and do not hesitate recommending full-fat dairy to people with diabetes that are in target range for their weight.""

Both experts agree that the focus should be on encouraging individuals to consume a variety of dairy products without putting too much emphasis on fat content. ""When people believe they have to eat only fat-free or low-fat dairy products, it can take away from the enjoyment of eating and may cause people to feel less satisfied and overeat as a result,"" explains Zanini.

Still, when it comes to diabetes and dairy choices, some options can be much more beneficial than others. Our experts weighed in on the best and worst choices.

The Best Dairy Choices to Make When You Have Diabetes
Greek Yogurt
""Fermented dairy products like yogurt are always great choices due to their natural source of probiotics, which has a positive effect on intestinal health and is linked to improved glucose and insulin levels in the body,"" explains Zanini. A review published in October 2017 in European Medical Journal noted that probiotics have been able to lower fasting glucose and insulin levels in a preclinical setting as well as in human trials. ""Greek yogurt provides the perfect combination of carbohydrate and protein,"" adds Smithson. Enjoy it alone, topped with nuts, or mixed into smoothies. You can even use plain Greek yogurt as an ingredient in baked goods to cut down on added fats.

String Cheese
""Cheese can be a good option to balance out a meal or snack by adding good sources of protein and a little fat,"" explains Zanini. ""With minimal carbohydrates (just one gram per ounce), cheese won't spike blood glucose readings,"" adds Smithson.

Grass-Fed Dairy
""The source of the dairy, and not just the fat content, should also be taken into consideration,"" points out Zanini who adds ""dairy from grass-fed cows will provide products that are higher in alpha-linolenic acid, a type of omega-3 fatty acid with many health benefits."" Look for grass-fed yogurt and cheese options in your local grocery store.

The Dairy Choices to Limit When You Have Diabetes
Fat-Free Milk
""I typically encourage my clients to avoid fat-free milk since this is actually often used to treat hypoglycemia due to its quick absorption rate in the body and quicker blood sugar response,"" explains Zanini, who recommends unsweetened almond milk as a better alternative. Smithson adds that how you consume this beverage also has an impact on blood glucose levels. She notes that milk is often paired with carb-containing foods, such as cereal or cookies, and together that combination may raise blood sugar readings.

Sweetened Dairy Products
Chocolate milk, ice cream, and yogurts with added sugar do not have to be off limits, but extra attention needs to be taken when including them into a diabetes meal plan. ""Sweetened options can be included, but you need to account for the extra carbohydrates these food contain,"" explains Smithson. ""Enjoy them infrequently and in moderation,"" added Zanini.

"Background: The association between plant-based diets and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains poorly characterized. Given that diet represents an important and a modifiable risk factor, this study aimed to assess (1) the relationships between the impact of adherence to plant-based diets on cardiovascular mortality, incident CVD, and stroke; (2) if associations differed by adherence to healthful and less healthful plant-based diets.

Methods and Findings: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to May 2021. Studies assessing CVD outcomes with relation to plant-based dietary patterns or according to plant-based dietary indices (PDI) were included. A meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HR) was conducted using DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Thirteen studies involving 410,085 participants were included. Greater adherence to an overall plant-based dietary pattern was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (pooled HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99 p = 0.0193, I2 = 88.5%, N = 124,501) and a lower risk of CVD incidence (pooled HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82–0.98, p = 0.0173, I2 = 87.2%, N = 323,854). Among the studies that used PDI, unhealthful plant-based diets were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (pooled HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09, p = 0.0123, I2 = 0.00%, N = 18,966), but not CVD incidence. Conversely, healthful plant-based diets were associated with decreased CVD incidence (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80–0.95, p = 0.0011, I2 = 57.5%, N = 71,301), but not mortality. Vegetarians also had significantly lower CVD incidence (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72–0.91, p = 0.0004, I2 = 22.2%, N = 16,254), but similar CVD mortality or stroke risk when compared to the meat-eaters.

Conclusion: To date, this comprehensive study examines the effects of a plant-based diet on major clinical endpoints using more holistic PDIs. These findings highlight the favorable role of healthful plant-based foods in reducing cardiovascular mortality and CVD.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, accounting for 32% of all global deaths in 2019 (1). In 2016, 3,63,452 and 1,42,142 individuals died from ischemic heart disease and stroke, respectively in the United States alone (2). Given the significant mortality and morbidity, diet represents an important modifiable risk factor that impacts other cardiovascular risk factors in the management of CVD.

Growing evidence suggests potential cardiovascular benefits of plant-based diets and dietary patterns (3), defined as a dietary profile, which emphasizes the high intake of plant-based food products while limiting the intake of animal products. Higher consumption of plant foods has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure and plasma triglyceride levels, thereby exerting protective effects against obesity and incident diabetes (4–7). Besides reducing CVD risk factors, previous studies have also indicated an association between plant-based diets and improved quality of life, such as an improved quality of sleep, reduced likelihood of mental health disorders, and decreased rate of cognitive decline (8–10).

Current literature on the association between a plant-based diet with major CVD clinical endpoints remain poorly characterized as prior studies have defined vegetarian or vegan diets based on the exclusion of animal food consumption (11–13). In 2012, Huang et al. found that vegetarians had a 29% lower ischemic heart disease associated mortality rate as compared to non-vegetarians (14). In contrast, a more recent study in 2019 revealed no significant association between vegetarian dietary pattern and CVD or stroke mortality (15), while another study in 2020 suggested that plant-based diets did not have a significant impact on CVD mortality amongst patients with diabetes (16), yielding conflicting results. This classification method fails to account for the opposing health effects of various plant-based food groups (17, 18), such as unhealthful refined grains, starches, and sugars as opposed to whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. However, there have since been new developments in plant-based diet scores with more studies utilizing the plant-based dietary index (PDI) where dietary scores are calculated based on gradations of adherence to a predominantly plant-based diet. Furthermore, variations such as the healthful and unhealthful PDI allow holistic assessment of the synergistic effects within dietary compositions (19, 20). Additionally, previous literature reported survival outcomes in risk ratio which does not account for censored data (14, 21–23), instead of hazard ratio which has been heralded as the gold standard approach in time-dependent survival analysis (24). Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to consolidate updated evidence and provide a more robust estimate of the overall effect of adherence to a plant-based diet on cardiovascular mortality, CVD, and stroke outcomes in hazard ratio. Additionally, this study also sought to assess if associations differed by adherence to healthful and less healthful plant-based diets based on a priori defined PDIs.

Methods
Search Strategy
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021265684) with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses 2020 for its synthesis (25). Two electronic databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched for articles relating to plant-based diets and cardiovascular health outcomes from inception to May 30, 2021. Search terms included ""plant-based diet,"" ""vegetarian,"" ""vegan,"" its related synonyms, ""cardiovascular mortality,"" and ""cardiovascular diseases"" as outcome terms. The full search strategy can be found in the Supplementary File 1. All references were imported into Endnote X9 for duplicate removal. The references of the included articles were also manually screened to ensure all relevant articles were included.

Eligibility and Selection Criteria
Two authors (JXQ and GL) independently performed the title abstract sieve and full-text review based on the predefined inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus or in consultation with a third independent author (NWSC). Only original articles in the English language were included, excluding conference abstracts, reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The primary exposure of interest was adherence to plant-based dietary patterns, defined as higher consumption of plant-based foods and lower consumption or exclusion of animal-based foods. In line with this definition, vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns were also classified under plant-based dietary patterns. Thus, the inclusion criteria were prospective cohort studies involving vegan or vegetarian participants or studies that assessed the plant-based diet of the subjects using various PDIs such as healthful PDI (hPDI) and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) with reported outcomes on cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease, or stroke events. The exclusion criteria included (1) studies that focused on single food groups such as vegetables, beans, nuts, or specific cruciferous vegetables that did not reflect a major part of the diet; (2) studies that used a priori indices such as healthy eating index, alternate Mediterranean diet score, and dietary approaches to stop hypertension; and (3) studies which did not provide outcomes of interests in the hazard ratio (HR).

Data Extraction
Relevant data from included articles were extracted by a pair of independent authors (JXQ and GL) into a structured proforma. The primary outcomes of interest were cardiovascular mortality, CVD, and stroke. Cardiovascular mortality was defined in accordance to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th or 10th edition (26, 27), whereas CVD was defined as the composite endpoint of coronary heart disease including non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction, heart failure defined as hospitalization or death with reference to ICD-9 code 428 and ICD-10 code I50, or stroke including definite or probable stroke. Stroke was defined according to (1) the World Health Organisation (WHO) as focal neurological deficit lasting >24 h or non-focal neurological symptoms with imaging consistent of stroke (28), or (2) identified based on the ICD-8, 9, or 10 codes including total, ischemic, or haemorrhagic stroke. Study characteristics were also extracted, including author, year, country, study design, follow-up duration, sample size, patient demographics i.e., age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alcohol history, smoking history, dietary assessment method, type of PDI, level of intake category (e.g., tertile, quantile, or quintile), and covariates that were adjusted for in the statistical models. For studies that used dietary indices, hazard estimates comparing the best (highest quintile/quantile) and poorest (lowest quintile/quantile) adherence to the plant-based dietary pattern were extracted. For studies that compared plant-based dietary patterns, the authors extracted the hazard estimates which compared diets that are most restrictive of animal-based foods such as vegan or vegetarian diets with the least restrictive, such as regular meat-eaters. All extracted information were checked independently by both authors to ensure accuracy of data collection with any discrepancies resolved through further discussion to reach a consensus.

Statistical Analysis and Quality Assessment
All analysis was done in R studio (Version 1.3.1,093) using the meta package. A conventional pairwise meta-analysis was conducted in hazard ratio using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to assess the association of plant-based diets with cardiovascular health outcomes (29). The risk estimate with the greatest degree of statistical adjustment was included in the meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic and the Cochran Q test, where a p-value of ? 0.10 was considered significant for heterogeneity (30, 31). An I2 value of 25, 50, and 75% represented low, moderate, and a high degree of heterogeneity, respectively (30). The random effects model was used in all analyses regardless of heterogeneity as recent evidence suggests that it can provide more robust outcome measures in comparison to the fixed effects model (32). However, I2 may be an inferior estimate when the sample size is large, leading to falsely elevated levels of heterogeneity (33, 34).

To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, the analysis was stratified according to definitions of plant-based diets i.e., vegetarian diet vs. plant-based dietary scores. In studies that classified adherence to plant-based dietary patterns using overall PDI, subgroup comparison was conducted for hPDI vs. uPDI to analyze the effects of quality of plant-based foods on cardiovascular health. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the respective funnel plots (35). For quality assessment of the included studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) for cohort studies was utilized to assess the risk of bias based on several parameters including appropriateness of sample frame, sampling method, ascertainment of exposure, the demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study, comparability of cohorts, methods for assessment of outcomes, duration of follow-up, and adequacy of follow-up (36).

A systematic search of the literature yielded a total of 605 references before 103 duplicates were removed, following which 386 articles were excluded after the title abstract sieve. In addition, nine studies were retrieved for full text review after screening the references of included articles and other meta-analyses (14, 21, 22, 37–41). A total of 125 studies were selected for full text review, of which 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis (Figure 1). In total, 410,085 participants were included in our analysis, and 78,671 subjects were identified as vegetarian or vegan. Eight articles originated from North America (11, 42–48), four articles from Europe (12, 20, 49, 50), and one article from Asia (51). Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics and quality assessment of the included studies.

Included studies were prospective cohort studies with the mean age of the participants ranging from 38 to 67 years and mean BMI ranging from 23.0 to 29.7 kg/m2. The majority of the studies administered food frequency questionnaires to assess the dietary intake of participants (11, 20, 42–48, 50, 51), out of which four studies involved trained interviewers (20, 44, 46, 51). Three studies derived the plant-based dietary patterns of participants using a factor analysis approach (45, 47, 48) compared with the six studies which calculated plant-based dietary scores using PDI (42–44, 46, 49, 52). In total, four studies characterized adherence to plant-based dietary patterns using overall PDI (43, 44, 46, 52), four studies used hPDI (42, 44, 46, 49), four studies used uPDI (43, 44, 46, 52), and two studies used provegetarian food pattern (20, 44). In addition, four studies compared individuals following a vegetarian dietary pattern with regular meat eaters (11, 12, 50, 51). The majority of included studies were found to have a low risk of bias (n = 10) (11, 12, 20, 42–44, 46, 49, 51) whereas the remaining studies were at moderate risk of bias (n = 3) (45, 47, 48).

Overall Analysis
The pooled analysis of seven studies involving 1,24,501 and 3,23,854 subjects demonstrated that a greater adherence to an overall plant-based dietary pattern was significantly associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality (pooled HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, p = 0.0193, I2 = 88.5%, N = 124,501) and lower risk of CVD incidence (pooled HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82– 0.98, p = 0.0173, I2 = 87.2%, N = 323,854), respectively. However, there was a non-significant decrease in the risks of total stroke with greater adherence to an overall plant-based diet (pooled HR: 0.86, CI: 0.69 - 1.08, p = 0.190, I2 = 79.1%, N = 64,204). However, there was no evidence of publication bias from the funnel plots in the Supplementary File 2.

Plant-Based Dietary Index
Cardiovascular Mortality
When results were stratified by studies (n = 7) that assessed plant-based diets using overall PDI, there was a non-significant decrease in cardiovascular mortality between subjects with the greatest adherence to a plant-based diet in the highest quintile compared with the least adherent subjects in the lowest quintile (pooled HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.76–1.05, p = 0.184, I2 = 91.7%, N = 28,844). Similarly, among studies using hPDI to calculate diet scores, cardiovascular mortality was found to be comparable between those in the highest and lowest quintile (pooled HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.79–1.05, p = 0.190, I2 = 92.1%, N = 52,770). In contrast, studies that utilized uPDI showed a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for subjects who adhered most closely to an unhealthful diet as compared with the least adherent subjects (pooled HR: 1.05, CI: 1.01–1.09, p = 0.0123, I2 = 0.00%, N = 18,966). There was a significant difference between hPDI and uPDI (p = 0.05) (Figure 2). Heterogeneity was high with I2 of 91.7 and 92.1% for overall PDI and hPDI, respectively, in contrast to uPDI which yielded low heterogeneity with I2 of 0.00%.

Cardiovascular Disease
Pooled analysis of seven studies using overall PDI showed that subjects with the greatest adherence to a plant-based diet had significantly lower risks of CVD compared with those who were the least adherent (pooled HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81–0.96, p = 0.0054, I2 = 34.2%, N = 211,585). For studies using hPDI to calculate diet scores, subjects who were the most adherent to a healthful plant-based diet also had a decreased risk of CVD compared with those who were the least adherent (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80–0.95, p = 0.0011, I2 = 57.5%, N = 71,301). However, analysis of studies utilizing uPDI showed no significant association between CVD and adherence of participants to an unhealthful plant-based diet (pooled HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.79–1.56, p = 0.555, I2 = 95.5%, N = 2,21,177). There was no significant subgroup difference between studies utilizing hPDI compared with uPDI (p-value: 0.18). There was low, moderate, and high heterogeneity with I2 of 34.2, 57.5, and 95.5% in overall PDI, hPDI, and uPDI analysis, respectively.

Vegetarian Only
Participants following a vegetarian diet had a non-significant decrease in cardiovascular mortality compared with regular meat eaters (pooled HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78–1.01, p = 0.0611, I2 = 0.00%, N = 58,274). However, vegetarians were found to have significantly reduced risks of CVD compared with regular meat eaters (pooled HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72 - 0.91, p = 0.0004, I2 = 22.2%, N = 16,254). There was low heterogeneity for both cardiovascular mortality and CVD analysis with I2 of 0.00 and 22.2%, respectively. Further analysis showed a non-significant decreased risk of total stroke (pooled HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.36–1.41, p = 0.333, I2 = 81.9% N = 20,397), hemorrhagic stroke (pooled HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.19–3.09, p = 0.709, I2 = 84.8%, N = 18,973) and ischemic stroke (pooled HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.22–1.42, p = 0.219, I2 = 81.9%, N = 20,397) between vegetarians and regular meat eaters. There were high levels of heterogeneity with I2 of 87.3, 84.8, and 81.9% for total stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke, respectively.

Discussion
To our knowledge, the present study provides comprehensive evidence on the associations between plant-based diets and major clinical endpoints including cardiovascular mortality, risk of CVD, and stroke. Previous analyses largely focused on vegetarian cohorts or proximal determinants of CVD and failed to clearly define the impact of adherence to plant-based dietary patterns on key clinical outcomes (11–15, 17, 18). However, in these meta-analyses of 410,085 individuals, we found that greater adherence to an overall plant-based dietary pattern significantly reduced the risks of cardiovascular mortality and development of CVD by 8.1% and 10.2%, respectively. Healthful plant-based diets including higher intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, tea, and coffee were found to have protective effects against CVD, whereas unhealthful plant-based diets were found to increase cardiovascular mortality (Table 2).

The cardiovascular benefits from plant-based diets have been attributed to a higher intake of fiber, plant protein, plant-based unsaturated fatty acids, phytochemicals (e.g., antioxidants and plant sterols), with a lower intake of saturated fat and energy density (53). Consequently, this reduces intermediate CVD risk factors, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and body weight (4, 54–57). Obesity has also been suggested to be a prominent CVD risk factor through adversely affecting plasma lipids, thus diminishing the cardioprotective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (58). Hence, the reduction of body fat through the consumption of plant-based diets may help to delay CVD initiation or progression (59, 60). Furthermore, the antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties of the bioactive compounds found in fruits and vegetables may also confer cardioprotective effects (61–63). Thus, vegetarian diets have been proposed to ameliorate inflammatory processes that underlie the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic CVD (64–66).

Our results on an overall plant-based diet and lowered risk of CVD are broadly consistent with prior studies which found a lowered incidence of coronary or ischemic heart disease among vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians (15, 22). However, unlike previous studies (15, 22), greater adherence to plant-based diets was found to decrease cardiovascular mortality with the inclusion of more recent studies (42, 43, 46). In addition, this divergence may partly be explained by the differing definitions of plant-based diets where prior studies defined vegetarianism based on the complete exclusion of some or all animal foods (11–13). Comparatively, this review further examined gradations of adherence to a predominantly plant-based diet based on diet scores derived from PDIs (42–44, 46–49, 52). Importantly, these recently newly developed plant-based indices allow the quantification of synergistic effects of dietary compositions and hold wide applicability in the healthcare setting as recommendations of moderate dietary changes, such as gradual reductions in animal food intake, and are likely easier to adopt and adhere to than the complete exclusion of animal foods (53). However, adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet was found to increase cardiovascular mortality. Those in the highest quintile of uPDI consumed foods with higher glycemic load and index, more added sugar, and lower levels of dietary fiber, unsaturated fats, micronutrients, and antioxidants, potentially contributing to poorer glycemic control (19, 67), lipid metabolism (68), and weight gain (69, 70). Particularly, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been found to be positively associated with mortality primarily through CVD mortality, exhibiting a graded association with dose (71). Regardless, these findings should be interpreted with caution considering the small number of studies, and further investigation to confirm the impact of an unhealthful plant-based diet on cardiovascular mortality is warranted.

Current guidelines by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (72), the American Dietetic Association (73), and most recently, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020 (74) recommend appropriately planned vegetarian diets for improved health. The key elements of the eating pattern include reduction in animal products, highly refined grains, added sugars, and oils, and consumption of an abundance of fresh vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. In key randomized clinical trials of plant-based diets, low-glycemic index foods were also found to improve cardiovascular risk factors (75). Besides emphasizing the quality of food in plant-based dietary patterns, guidelines should also develop appropriate resources and tools for healthcare professionals to effectively counsel their patients on plant-based nutrition therapy (76). Interestingly, plant-based diets have been shown to be as acceptable as other therapeutic diets, suggesting their suitability for long-term use (77–79). For instance, large healthcare organizations such as Kaiser Permanente have been successfully promoting vegetarian diets for patients as a cost-effective, low-risk solution that targets multiple chronic diseases simultaneously (80).

Strengths and Limitations
Hitherto, plant-based diets have not been examined in randomized controlled trials of hard cardiovascular endpoints, possibly limited by the long induction periods of CVD with respect to its dietary etiology. This study, therefore, presents high quality evidence for major clinical endpoints such as cardiovascular mortality, CVD, and stroke by pooling a robust sample size of 410,085 participants in HR which remains the gold standard for time-dependent survival analysis. Most included studies were adjusted for important confounders including age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol history. In addition, dietary intake was largely assessed via the validated food frequency questionnaire which has been shown to have high reproducibility (81). However, several limitations should be accounted for when interpreting the study results. First, I2, a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly large in this analysis albeit attributable to the large sample size. It is well recognized that large sample sizes often inflate heterogeneity estimates (33, 34), as seen in a previous study involving a large cohort, resulting in an I2 > 90% (82). Most included studies originated from North America and Europe, except for one study from Asia. Given that plant-based dietary patterns are likely to vary across cultural contexts (83), more evidence is warranted to determine the cardiovascular effects of a plant-based diet within the Asian population. Further stratifications to examine the effects of gender and the duration of adherence to the plant-based pattern on cardiovascular health were also limited with the available data. Nevertheless, the beneficial effects on established proximal determinants of CVD in addition to the inverse association between plant-based dietary patterns and cardiovascular mortality in our pooled analysis lend strong support for the favorable role of quality plant-based foods in promoting cardiometabolic health.

Conclusion
This study provides important evidence to suggest a possible protective role of plant-based dietary patterns against cardiovascular mortality and CVD among the general population. Importantly, not all plant foods are equally beneficial, but unhealthful refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and oils should be avoided. In future studies, it may be worth exploring the potential of healthful plant-based diets as secondary prevention among patients with preexisting CVD and the dose-response association between the level of plant food intake and cardiovascular benefits.";https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.756810/full;"background : association plant-based diets cardiovascular disease ( cvd )

"The sugar-free plan is one of the most famous, and most followed, eating plans out there - but what exactly is it?

Experts around the world have been warning about the dangers of excess sugar for generations - and for good reason. Many of us underestimate our sugar consumption and our children's sugar intake, too. Yet too much of the sweet stuff, in most of its forms, can have a seriously negative impact on the body.

So whether you're looking to sustainably cut sugar out of your diet completely or just look for easy ways to reduce your sugar intake, without having to detox, our expert-approved plan can help.

What is the sugar-free plan?
The sugar-free plan is a week-long plan that involves following the golden rules of the sugar-free diet for days 1-3. On days 4-7, you add a healthy dessert in the evening, such as fruit salad, yogurt or fromage frais with stewed fruit.

The golden rules of the sugar-free diet plan:

No desserts, no fruit and no sugar in drinks 
No juices, squashes or diet colas
Drink tea, coffee (no sugar or sweeteners) milk, plain water
No ketchup, brown sauce, Thai or Chinese-type sweet and sour sauces
Base your meals around meat, fish and eggs
A carbohydrate breakfast of unsweetened cereal is allowed.
Why is eating sugar bad for you?
Sugar leads to increased inflammation in the body and the potential onset of serious diseases. Dee Momi, nutritionist & founder of MINT Wellbeing, says this can manifest in all sorts of ways. 

She explains: ""From the most obviously visible - weight gain (particularly around the belly area), a higher risk of developing acne and fluctuating moods - to the more critical, including increasing your risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.""

Sugar also has the potential to disrupt an area of the brain, nutrition researcher from Brain Freed Ltd, Dishalni Senthilkumaran, says. ""Excess sugar can have an inflammatory effect on the brain’s memory centre and can be an increased risk factor in cognitive decline, whilst a 2017 study at UCL also sugar increases the likelihood of anxiety and depression."" It can also deplete essential nutrients in our body, including magnesium.

We know that sugar can cause a positive 'rush' over a short period of time. And while this is typically associated with hyperactivity in children, sugar actually triggers pleasure responses in adults too. ""Sugar triggers your reward and pleasure chemical dopamine, which is released when you derive pleasure from great food, sex and a sense of accomplishment. Excess dopamine can reduce novelty and prompt impulsive behaviour.""

Coming down from a sugar rush as your blood sugar levels return to normal can leave you feeling fatigued, thirsty, with headaches and frequent need to urinate.

Along with the long-term risks of disease and the mental impacts, sugar is famously bad for your dental hygiene. The NHS say that sugary food and drinks are in fact one of the main causes of tooth decay, as ""acid is produced when the bacteria in your mouth break down the sugar. The acid dissolves the tooth surface, which is the first stage of tooth decay.""

So with sugar proven to affect your weight, long-term health risks, mental health and dental hygiene, how can you cut back? This is the plan to follow.

How having a sugar free diet can help you lose weight
To lose weight, you have to be in a calorie deficit. Consuming lots of sugary foods - such as processed and mass-produced foods including juices, cooking sauces and condiments - that contain fructose can make this process harder, since these foods also tend to be high in calories. 

""When consumed, this type of sugar increases your hunger leading to a craving for more food."" Nutritionist Dee says, ""The hormone leptin helps the body to regulate hunger and alerts you when to stop eating - but consuming fructose in excess confuses this natural process.""

That being said, health and lifestyle coach Ryan Hodgson warns that we need to stop demonising sugar and seeing it as the enemy. Instead, he says, ""We need to become aware that actually often nutritional related health problems stem from overconsumption of calories as opposed to too much of one specific nutrient.

""It happens to to be that those who over consume on calories often eat a high carbohydrate (sugar) diet because carbs aren’t as satisfying as the other macronutrients (proteins and fats). Correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, particularly in the instance of more sugar in the diet and poor health. It’s more the overall eating habits.

""For those who perhaps to find themselves wanting to go for higher sugar foods, I’d suggest looking at meals and snacks and asking the questions: What protein source am I getting here (protein will help reduce sugar cravings and keep you fuller)? Am I hydrated enough? Am I really craving sugar or do I just need to eat a well balanced meal? It’s also important to be aware of how sugar can impact the body and abstaining from it. I’ve seen many people try cut sugar out and not felt great from it, it can affect you hormonally, mentally and physically too. Remember sugar isn’t the enemy, but also the body doesn’t ‘need’ carbs (or sugar), it needs protein (essential amino acids), it needs fats (essential fatty acids), but it doesn’t need carbs. We just often feel and perform better when we include them in our diet.”

To make a change, nutritionist Dee suggests starting small. ""The single easiest way to curb sugar in your diet is to remove or excessively reduce the amount of sugary drinks you may be consuming as they are loaded with fructose and offer very little to no nutritional value. If it's too big a step to cut them out completely, wean yourself off them gradually and replace every 2nd or 3rd drink with fruit infused sparkling water, or a cordial with a lower sugar content.""

You can also reduce dependency on sugary pre-made sauces and flavourings by replacing it with more wholefoods-based products. ""Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and curry leaves actually help lower and regulate blood sugar levels so you don't experience the highs and dips that follow processed sugar consumption."" Dee says, ""Adding a little natural fat such as olive oil, coconut milk or avocado satiates the body, leaving us comfortably satisfied.""";https://www.goodto.com/wellbeing/sugar-free-diet-83093;sugar-free plan one famous , followed , eating plans - exactly ? experts around world warning dangers excess sugar generations - good reason . many us underestimate sugar consumption children 's sugar intake , . yet much sweet stuff , forms , seriously negative impact body . whether 're looking sustainably cut sugar diet completely look easy ways reduce sugar intake , without detox , expert-approved plan help . sugar-free plan ? sugar-free plan week-long plan involves following golden rules sugar-free diet days 1-3. days 4-7 , add healthy dessert evening , fruit salad , yogurt fromage frais stewed fruit . golden rules sugar-free diet plan : desserts , fruit sugar drinks juices , squashes diet colas drink tea , coffee ( sugar sweeteners ) milk , plain water ketchup , brown sauce , thai chinese-type sweet sour sauces base meals around meat , fish eggs carbohydrate breakfast unsweetened cereal allowed . eating sugar bad ? sugar leads increased inflammation body potential onset serious diseases . dee momi , nutritionist & founder mint wellbeing , says manifest sorts ways . explains : `` obviously visible - weight gain ( particularly around belly area ) , higher risk developing acne fluctuating moods - critical , including increasing risk cancer , type 2 diabetes heart disease .

Plant-based diets are also associated with lower risks for certain cancers. But what about prostate cancer specifically?

Earlier this year, researchers published results from a comprehensive review of the literature on plant-based diets and prostate cancer risk. They concluded that apart from having advantages for cardiovascular health and quality of life, plant-based diets have the potential to improve prostate cancer outcomes.

Plants contain a number of anti-cancer compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, and resveratrol. Cooking meat, on the other hand (especially red and processed meats) generates two types of carcinogens: heterocyclic amines, which arise during pan-searing, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are produced by grilling or barbecuing.

The researchers behind this new review assessed 32 studies evaluating possible links between plant-based diets and lower prostate cancer risk. A third of the studies were observational, meaning that the research had relied on pre-existing information contained in databases and health registries. The rest of the studies were interventional; the enrolled subjects in these studies were prostate cancer patients who had been followed over time to see if dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and other lifestyle interventions would lead to better outcomes.

In general, the studies leaned toward beneficial effects from consuming plant-based meals. Most of the observational studies found that plant-eaters developed prostate cancer at lower rates than meat-eaters. And 60% of the interventional studies reported that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased more slowly in plant-eaters compared to meat-eaters. A rise in PSA suggests prostate cancer is worsening, or recurring in men who have already been treated for the disease.

Commentary and context
The review authors singled out the evidence on PSA, as well as better overall health and delayed needs for additional prostate cancer treatment among plant-eaters, to support a conclusion that vegetarian diets are protective. However, large-scale clinical trials are still needed to confirm the association, cautioned Dr. Stephen Freedland, a urologist and the director of the Center for Integrated Research in Cancer and Lifestyle at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

In a follow-up editorial this past October, Dr. Freedland and his co-authors emphasized shortcomings in the existing data. For instance, the interventional studies cited in the recent review paper are small (fewer than 100 subjects each), with follow-ups lasting no more than a year, and the observational evidence is hardly unanimous, given that some studies detected no association between prostate cancer risk and vegetarian diets, while others generated mixed results.

Yet another problem is lack of consensus on what constitutes a plant-based diet. Definitions can range from extreme vegan, to semi-vegetarian, or primarily plant-based, where some meat consumption is allowed. Indeed, one of the interventions cited in the review was described as ""an increase in plant-based food and oily fish and a reduction or elimination of land-animal-based protein.""

""What we really need in this area are more rigorously designed, well-controlled randomized clinical trials,"" Dr. Freedland says. ""We need to sort out whether diet is really protective, or if vegetarians and vegans are simply more health-conscious in other ways. Are they exercising more? Do they have better access to health care? Do they live in places with better air quality? These are the questions we need to answer.""

Despite these limitations, Dr. Freedland described the evidence associating vegetarianism and lower prostate cancer risk as intriguing and encouraging. In the meantime, he advises that the best lifestyle strategy for reducing cancer risk overall is to avoid obesity. ""That's where we have the best evidence,"" he says.

"Too much added sugar can be one of the greatest threats to cardiovascular disease. Here's how to curb your sweet habit.
Sugar has a bittersweet reputation when it comes to health. Sugar occurs naturally in all foods that contain carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, grains, and dairy. Consuming whole foods that contain natural sugar is okay. Plant foods also have high amounts of fiber, essential minerals, and antioxidants, and dairy foods contain protein and calcium.

Since your body digests these foods slowly, the sugar in them offers a steady supply of energy to your cells. A high intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains also has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.
Consuming too much sugar
However, problems occur when you consume too much added sugar — that is, sugar that food manufacturers add to products to increase flavor or extend shelf life.

In the American diet, the top sources are soft drinks, fruit drinks, flavored yogurts, cereals, cookies, cakes, candy, and most processed foods. But added sugar is also present in items that you may not think of as sweetened, like soups, bread, cured meats, and ketchup.

The result: we consume way too much added sugar. Adult men take in an average of 24 teaspoons of added sugar per day, according to the National Cancer Institute. That's equal to 384 calories.

""Excess sugar's impact on obesity and diabetes is well documented, but one area that may surprise many men is how their taste for sugar can have a serious impact on their heart health,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Impact on your heart
In a study published in 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine, Dr. Hu and his colleagues found an association between a high-sugar diet and a greater risk of dying from heart disease. Over the course of the 15-year study, people who got 17% to 21% of their calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared with those who consumed 8% of their calories as added sugar.

""Basically, the higher the intake of added sugar, the higher the risk for heart disease,"" says Dr. Hu.

How sugar actually affects heart health is not completely understood, but it appears to have several indirect connections. For instance, high amounts of sugar overload the liver. ""Your liver metabolizes sugar the same way as alcohol, and converts dietary carbohydrates to fat,"" says Dr. Hu. Over time, this can lead to a greater accumulation of fat, which may turn into fatty liver disease, a contributor to diabetes, which raises your risk for heart disease.

Consuming too much added sugar can raise blood pressure and increase chronic inflammation, both of which are pathological pathways to heart disease. Excess consumption of sugar, especially in sugary beverages, also contributes to weight gain by tricking your body into turning off its appetite-control system because liquid calories are not as satisfying as calories from solid foods. This is why it is easier for people to add more calories to their regular diet when consuming sugary beverages.

""The effects of added sugar intake — higher blood pressure, inflammation, weight gain, diabetes, and fatty liver disease — are all linked to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke,"" says Dr. Hu.

How much is okay?
If 24 teaspoons of added sugar per day is too much, then what is the right amount? It's hard to say, since sugar is not a required nutrient in your diet. The Institute of Medicine, which sets Recommended Dietary Allowances, or RDAs, has not issued a formal number for sugar.

However, the American Heart Association suggests that women consume no more than 100 calories (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) and men no more than 150 calories (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams) of added sugar per day. That is close to the amount in a 12-ounce can of soda.

Subtracting added sugar
Reading food labels is one of the best ways to monitor your intake of added sugar. Look for the following names for added sugar and try to either avoid, or cut back on the amount or frequency of the foods where they are found:

brown sugar
corn sweetener
corn syrup
fruit juice concentrates
high-fructose corn syrup
honey
invert sugar
malt sugar
molasses
syrup sugar molecules ending in ""ose"" (dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, sucrose).
Total sugar, which includes added sugar, is often listed in grams. Note the number of grams of sugar per serving as well as the total number of servings. ""It might only say 5 grams of sugar per serving, but if the normal amount is three or four servings, you can easily consume 20 grams of sugar and thus a lot of added sugar,"" says Dr. Hu.

Also, keep track of sugar you add to your food or beverages. About half of added sugar comes from beverages, including coffee and tea. A study in the May 2017 Public Health found that about two-thirds of coffee drinkers and one-third of tea drinkers put sugar or sugary flavorings in their drinks. The researchers also noted that more than 60% of the calories in their beverages came from added sugar.

Yet, Dr. Hu warns against being overzealous in your attempts to cut back on added sugar, as this can backfire. ""You may find yourself reaching for other foods to satisfy your sweet cravings, like refined starches, such as white bread and white rice, which can increase glucose levels, and comfort foods high in saturated fat and sodium, which also cause problems with heart health,"" he says.

"It's true that eating large amounts of added sugar can make you more likely to develop diabetes, but sugar intake is just one piece of the puzzle. Still, regularly eating lots of sugar can raise your risk.

Many other factors - including overall diet, lifestyle, and genetics - also affect your chance of developing diabetes.

This article reviews sugar's role in developing diabetes and provides tips for preventing the disease.

What is diabetes?
Diabetes occurs when your body cannot effectively regulate blood sugar levels. This can happen when your pancreas stops producing enough insulin, your cells become resistant to insulin, or both.

Insulin is a hormone that moves sugar from your bloodstream and into your cells. If your body doesn't make enough or you become insulin resistant, you can develop chronically high blood sugar levels.

High blood sugar levels over a long period can increaseTrusted Source your risk of heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage, so it's essential to keep them in check.

There are two primary types of diabetes:

Type 1: This autoimmune disease happens when your immune system attacks your pancreas, destroying its ability to produce insulin.
Type 2: When the pancreas stops producing enough insulin, your body's cells no longer respond to the insulin it produces or both.
Type 1 diabetes is relatively rare, accounting for about 5–10%Trusted Source of diabetes cases worldwide.

Type 2 diabetes - the focus of this article - accounts for more than 90% of diabetes cases. It's primarily triggered by diet and lifestyle factors.

Does sugar increase your risk of diabetes?
According to research, regularly consuming sugar-sweetened beverages can increaseTrusted Source your risk of type 2 diabetes.

Data from 175 countries found that sugar intake was significantly correlatedTrusted Source with diabetes risk. While high sugar intake increased the risk, low sugar intake reduced it.

Although these studies do not prove that sugar causes diabetes, the association is strong. Many researchers believe that sugar increases diabetes risk both directly and indirectly.

It may directly increase diabetes riskTrusted Source because of the impact fructose has on your liver.

Eating large amounts of sugar can also indirectly raise diabetes risk by contributing to weight gain and higher body fat - both of which are separate risk factors for developing diabetes.

To reduce the adverse effects of high sugar consumption, the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that no more than 10%Trusted Source of your total daily calories come from added sugars.

Natural sugars don't have the same effect
While eating large amounts of added sugars has been linked to diabetes, the same is not trueTrusted Source for natural sugars.

Natural sugars are found in fruits and vegetables and have not been added during manufacturing or processing. Because they're combined with fiber, water, and other nutrients, they're digested more slowly and are less likely to spike your blood sugar.

Fruits and vegetables also tend to contain far less sugar by weight than many processed foods, so it's easier to keep your consumption in check.

Fruit juice
Research is mixed on whether drinking 100% fruit juice increases diabetes risk.

Even when natural juice is high in sugar and low in fiber, it can spike your blood sugar. However, combining it with fat, fiber, and protein sources may prevent blood sugar spikes.

The American Diabetes Association recommends replacing fruit juice with water or calorie-free beverages.

Natural sweeteners
Though some natural sweeteners like honey and maple syrup are not as heavily processed as table sugar, they are still relatively pure sources of sugar and contain almost no fiber.

Many other sweeteners marketed as ""natural"" should also be considered added sugar. These include agave syrup, coconut sugar, and cane sugar, to name a few.

Do artificial sweeteners increase diabetes risk?
Artificial sweeteners are manufactured, sweet-tasting substances that cannot be metabolized for energy. They provide sweetness without any calories.

Though artificial sweeteners don't spike blood sugar levels, they have still been linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, experts don't fully understand why this is.

One theory is that artificially sweetened products increase cravings for sweet-tasting foods, causing you to eat more sugary foods. Another idea is that artificial sweeteners disrupt your body's ability to adequately compensate for calories consumed from sugar since your brain associates the sweet taste with zero calories.

However, it's important to note that for people with diabetes, diet soda is still a better option than full-sugar soda.

How sugar is metabolized
When most people talk about sugar, they're referring to sucrose, or table sugar.

Sucrose is composed of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose bonded together.

When you eat sucrose, the glucose and fructose molecules are separated by enzymes in your small intestine before being absorbed into your bloodstream. This raises blood sugar levels and tells your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin carries glucose from the bloodstream and into your cells, where it can be used for energy.

While a small amount of fructose can also be taken up by cells and used for energy, the majority is carried to your liver. There, it's either converted to glucose for energy or stored as fat.

Since fructose can be converted to fat, consuming a lot of it tends to increase triglyceride levels. This may increase your risk of heart disease and fatty liver disease.

A high fructose intake is also associatedTrusted Source with higher uric acid levels in the blood. If these uric acid crystals settle in your joints, you can develop gout. This is a painful condition that causes soreness and swelling in the joints.

Other risk factors for diabetes
While consuming large amounts of added sugar is linked to an increased risk of diabetes, many other factors are at play, such as:

Body weight: Research shows that obesity is one of the primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight can decrease your risk.
Exercise: People who live sedentary lifestyles have nearly twice the risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who are active. Just 150 minutes of moderate activity and up to 3 sessions of resistance training per week can reduce your risk.
Smoking: Smoking can significantly increaseTrusted Source your risk of diabetes, but quitting brings the risk nearly back to usual.
Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is obstructed during the night, is a unique risk factor for diabetes.
Genetics: Experts don't fully understand the role of genetics, but you're more likely to develop diabetes if one or both of your parents have it.
How to eat to lower your diabetes risk
In addition to cutting back on added sugars, there are many other dietary changes you can make to reduce your diabetes risk:

Follow a whole-food diet: Diets rich in nuts, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains have been linked to a reduced risk of diabetes.
Drink coffee: Drinking coffee without adding anything to it may reduceTrusted Source your risk of type 2 diabetes. Many popular coffee drinks are high in added sugar, so be mindful of what you add to yours.
Eat green leafy vegetables: Eating a diet rich in green leafy vegetables has been linked to a lower riskTrusted Source of diabetes.
If reducing your intake of added sugars feels overwhelming, you can start by simply reducing your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, which are the primary source of added sugars in the standard American diet.

This one small change could make a big impact.

Carefully reading nutrition labels is another must since there are over 50 names for sugar in food products. Learning to notice them is the first step in reducing your consumption.

There are many ways to reduce sugar while enjoying a flavorful and nutrient-dense diet so you don't have to feel deprived.
The bottom line
Excessive amounts of added sugars have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, likely due to adverse effects on the liver and a higher risk of obesity.

Natural sugars like those found in fruits and vegetables are not linked to diabetes risk, unlike artificial sweeteners.

In addition to sugar consumption, overall diet quality, body weight, sleep quality, physical activity, and genetics all play a role in the development of the disease.

A diet rich in fruits, whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats, vegetables, nuts, and coffee is recommended. Consuming alcohol in moderation, maintaining the recommended body weight for your age and height, and exercising regularly can also help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes.

"Eating certain kinds of fish has become a major health concern due to the amount of heavy metals and other contaminants found in water. Seafood is a healthy source of iodine, essential fats and easily digested protein and is often considered a healthy addition to any diet.  There are ways to safely eat fish, it's just a matter of how often and what kinds you choose.

What is a heavy metal?
There is no firm definition of what a heavy metal is, however some definitions are based on density. Copper, nickel, cadmium, iron, lead, mercury and zinc usually fit into this category. When considering heavy metals in the ocean and the effect on human health, lead, mercury and cadmium give the most cause for concern.

Heavy metals in the ocean     
Heavy metals accumulate in the ocean due to increased industrial activity and disposing of waste products into waterways. Overall there is an increase of heavy metals in our atmosphere which subsequently leads to an increase in ocean metal concentration. Believe it or not, heavy metals are a natural component of the earth's crust and weathering and erosion cause metals to wash from the land into the water.

Levels of heavy metals, especially mercury, accumulate in fish as they feed. It is also absorbed through their gills as they swim. Mercury in the water is converted by microorganisms to methylmercury which is the most dangerous form.

Who is at risk?
Every person who consumes seafood is at some risk. Mercury is a known neuro toxin that can bioaccumulate in humans causing:

numb or tingling fingers, lips and toes
developmental delays in children
muscle and joint pain
increased risk of heart attack.
Pregnant women are at greater risk as their unborn baby's nervous system is the most vulnerable to the effects of mercury. Mercury exposure may slow a child's development in the early years, affecting attention, memory and developmental milestones such as walking and talking. Even women who are planning to conceive in the next six months, infants and young children should also limit their exposure to heavy metals in fish.

Fish with the highest levels of mercury
Generally speaking, the larger and older the fish, the higher the level of heavy metal contamination. Other factors include species of fish and its location, diet and habitat. Fish that are at the top of the ocean food chain tend to contain more mercury.

Examples of fish to avoid:

Swordfish
King mackerel and tilefish
Shark
Barramundi
Gemfish
Orange roughy (deep sea perch)
Ling
Southern bluefin tuna
A guide to choosing the safest fish
Choose fresh, wild-caught fish from Australian and New Zealand waters. Imported fish, especially from Thailand, usually have much higher levels of contamination as fish are either farmed or caught in heavily polluted waters.

Here are some safer seafood options.
Shellfish, including prawns, lobsters and oysters
Salmon
Tinned tuna (chunk light, skipjack)
Snapper
Whiting
Anchovies
Perch
Cod
Calamari
If catching and eating your own fish, don't fish in polluted waters. Bottom feeder species, such as catfish, may ingest more pollutants.

Limiting your exposure
Avoid fish with higher levels of mercury and limit your seafood intake of safer fish to 2-3 serves per week to reduce heavy metal exposure. One serve of fish equates to 150g for adults and 75g for children.

Eliminating heavy metals
Another component to address is supporting your body so that it can safely eliminate heavy metals to prevent storage in tissues.

To reduce your heavy metal burden, eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables to supply your body with an abundance of antioxidants and fibre that support the bodies natural detoxification processes.

Coriander, zinc, selenium, milk thistle, vitamin C and chlorella are used in natural therapies to chelate heavy metals or support the health of our important detoxification organs such as the liver and kidneys.

Reasons to eat fish
Australia's leading health research body, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), suggests that Australians should eat more fish. Seafood, particularly fish, is considered an important part of any diet and if eaten within guidelines provides a source of calories and a range of important vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. It is rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids which encourages healthy heart, eyes, brain, joint and skin function. Regular consumption of fish can reduce the risk of various diseases and disorders including asthma, dementia, diabetes and inflammatory conditions. It is also high in iodine, B12, zinc and vitamins A and D (depending on species).

The future of our oceans
Due to increased awareness, changes in legislation and much research, the future is looking brighter. A major review of data collected in the last four years confirms that today's oceans contain far lower levels of mercury, DDT and other toxic substances in the last four decades. They found a significant drop in mercury concentrations-from about 50% for mercury to more than 90% for polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.

Things to remember
Avoid fish that contain higher amounts of mercury
Safely consume seafood with lower levels of heavy metals 2-3 times per week
These guidelines are particularly important for pregnant women, women planning to conceive within the next 6 months and children under the age of 6

"Our position statement
The Heart Foundation reviewed the science on red meat and poultry, to help you know what's best for your heart health.

Our position statement for meat includes:

red meat (including beef, veal, lamb, mutton, pork, venison and goat)
chicken
We didn't include processed meat in our position statement because there is already lots of research that shows eating processed meat is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer and heart disease 1-3.

What is red meat?
Red meat includes:

beef
veal
lamb
mutton
pork
goat
venison.
Red meat is rich in protein, with 20-25g protein in every 100g of meat. It's also an excellent source of iron, zinc, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and thiamine.

Half of the fat in red meat is saturated fat. The rest is unsaturated fat (mostly monounsaturated fat and just a small amount of polyunsaturated fat).

What is poultry?
Poultry includes most white meats. That means chicken, turkey and duck can be grouped under this term.

The Heart Foundation only considered chicken as part of the new position statement as turkey and duck are less common within the New Zealand diet.

Chicken is also a good protein source, as well as being a source of niacin, vitamin A, magnesium and zinc.

One third of the fat in chicken is saturated fat and the remaining two thirds is both mono- and poly-unsaturated fat.

How nutritious is red meat and poultry?
The quality of a piece of meat, and how good it is for you, depends on:

the type of animal
the breed
what it is fed (grains or grass)
the cut of meat such as sirloin or rump (for red meat)
the part of the bird such a wing, leg or thigh (for chicken)
The amount of fat you eat, when having chicken or red meat, depends on whether you cut off any fat or remove the skin. 

The way you cook meat also affects the fat content. Different cooking methods such as baking, frying or grilling, all influence the fat content. 

What is the difference between processed and unprocessed meat?
Unprocessed meat has not been altered in a way that processed meats have.

These types of meat are unprocessed:

steak
chops
mince
diced meat
Processed meats have been changed in some way to enhance the meat's flavour or to make it last for longer4. Ways of processing that can change meat includes:

salting
curing
fermentation
smoking
Processed meats are usually made from beef and pork, as well as poultry and offal1.

Examples of processed meats include:

sausages
ham and bacon
corned beef
canned meat
meat-based pre-prepared foods.
Is processed meat unhealthy?
Processed meats have been shown to increase the risk of bowel cancer. For each 50g portion of processed meat eaten daily the risk of bowel cancer increases by 18%4.

Processed meats can also have very high levels of salt and saturated fat. The Ministry of Health recommends adults eat less than 5g of salt (2000mg of sodium) a day to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and the risk of stroke.

Limiting or avoiding processed meats will help lower your intake of salt and saturated fat.

Processed meat, ham, sausages, 

Is red meat healthy?
The evidence shows that you can eat lean red meat as part of a heart healthy diet. However, high intakes of red meat increase your risk of heart disease and stroke by 16%5. Eating up to 100g/d of red meat increases risk of heart disease and stroke by 10-20%5. Therefore, the Heart Foundation suggests you aim for less than 350g of red meat per week.

If you do choose to eat red meat, think about how your red meat is prepared and cooked. Removing skin and visible fat is important, as well as choosing the leanest cuts.

Think quality over quantity.

If you do eat red meat, try replacing some of your red meat meals with vegetarian meals that use plant proteins (chickpeas, lentils and beans). There are health benefits to this and it's cheaper. Eating less red meat can also benefits the environment.

How often should I eat red meat?
If you choose to eat red meat, you should aim to eat no more than 350g of red meat each week. A recommended portion size of cooked meat is 100g6

This means that even after you reduce the amount of red meat you eat; you could still spread your red meat out across 2-3 meals each week.

It's important to eat a variety of protein sources through the week, other than just red meat.

Swapping 1-2 red meat meals a week with plant proteins like legumes, soy or nuts, could improve your cholesterol levels.

Chicken can also be eaten as a protein source, as well as other protein sources including:

fish
dairy
eggs
and nuts.
Meat portion sizes
Checking the weight of meat when you buy it is the best way to know how many portions you are getting. Some cuts of red meat, like chops or steak can be difficult as they all come in different shapes and sizes.  

Here is a rough guide to help keep your portions around 100g:

Individual cuts of meat aim for 125g of raw meat, this will cook down to your 100g portion size
500g of mince or diced beef/lamb/pork will provide 4 servings of meat
1 slice of roast meat is around 100g
1 lamb shank will make 2 meals.
Use some of our heart-healthy recipes to get you started:

Beef and lentil bolognese
Lebanese chickpea and eggplant stew
Broad bean falafel
Vegetable tom yum soup
Stir-fried rice
Saagwala curry
What does the Heart Foundation recommend?
If you do eat small amounts of red meat and poultry, the Heart Foundation recommends making sure that the rest of your diet is heart healthy7.

Try to:

Eat more vegetables and fruit
Swap from refined cereals and grains to whole grains
Choose reduced-fat dairy products
Eat healthy fats from nuts, seeds, plant oils (other than coconut and palm), avocado, and oily fish instead of animal fats
Eat less than 350g of unprocessed red meat a week (cooked weight) spread across 3 meals per week (with an individual portion size of 100g cooked red meat)
Swap some red meat meals for plant proteins such as soy, legumes and nuts
Limit, or avoid processed red meat
Limit or avoid processed foods such as junk food, takeaways, deep-fried foods, pastries, pies, sweet bakery items, lollies, highly processed and refined foods, processed snack foods and sugary drinks.";https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/wellbeing/healthy-eating/nutrition-facts/is-meat-good-for-you;"position statement heart foundation reviewed science red meat poultry , help know 's best heart health . position statement meat includes : red meat ( including beef , veal , lamb , mutton , pork , venison goat ) chicken n't include processed meat position statement already lots research shows eating processed meat linked increased risk bowel cancer heart disease 1-3. red meat ? red meat includes : beef veal lamb mutton pork goat venison . red meat rich protein , 20-25g protein every 100g meat .

"Boston, MA-People who eat just two servings of red meat per week may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who eat fewer servings, and the risk increases with greater consumption, according to a new study led by researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They also found that replacing red meat with healthy plant-based protein sources, such as nuts and legumes, or modest amounts of dairy foods, was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.

The study was published on Thursday, October 19, in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

""Our findings strongly support dietary guidelines that recommend limiting the consumption of red meat, and this applies to both processed and unprocessed red meat,"" said first author Xiao Gu, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.

While previous studies have found a link between red meat consumption and type 2 diabetes risk, this study, which analyzed a large number of type 2 diabetes cases among participants being followed for an extended period of years, adds a greater level of certainty about the association.

Type 2 diabetes rates are increasing rapidly in the U.S. and worldwide. This is concerning not only because the disease is a serious burden, but it also is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease, cancer, and dementia.

For this study, the researchers analyzed health data from 216,695 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). Diet was assessed with food frequency questionnaires every two to four years, for up to 36 years. During this time, more than 22,000 participants developed type 2 diabetes.

The researchers found that consumption of red meat, including processed and unprocessed red meat, was strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Participants who ate the most red meat had a 62% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who ate the least. Every additional daily serving of processed red meat was associated with a 46% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and every additional daily serving of unprocessed red meat was associated with a 24% greater risk.

The researchers also estimated the potential effects of substituting one daily serving of red meat for another protein source. They found that substituting a serving of nuts and legumes was associated with a 30% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, and substituting a serving of dairy products was associated with a 22% lower risk.

""Given our findings and previous work by others, a limit of about one serving per week of red meat would be reasonable for people wishing to optimize their health and wellbeing,"" said senior author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.

In addition to health benefits, swapping red meat for healthy plant protein sources would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and provide other environmental benefits, according to the researchers.

Other Harvard Chan School authors included Frank Sacks and Frank Hu.

The NHS, NHS II, and HPFS are supported by the National Institute of Health (grants UM1 CA186107, U01 CA176726, and U01 CA167552).

"The choices you make at the grocery store have a bigger impact than just your dinner plans. Filling your plate with foods that are grown in the ground may be the best diet for cancer prevention.

An estimated 1.9 million cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022, according to the American Cancer Society. While some people have a higher genetic risk to develop cancer, research shows that nearly 25% of overall cancer cases could be prevented with diet and nutrition alone. Many cancers can take 10 or more years to develop, so everyday nutrition choices are crucial in cancer prevention.

Plant-based diets are full of fruits, vegetables and legumes, with little or no meat or other animal products. In research studies, vegans, people who don't eat any animal products, including fish, dairy or eggs, appeared to have the lowest rates of cancer of any diet. The next lowest rate was for vegetarians, people who avoid meat but may eat fish or foods that come from animals, such as milk or eggs.

Plant-based foods do more than taste delicious. They are full of chemicals compounds, called phytochemicals, that protect the body from damage. Phytochemicals also interrupt processes in the body that encourage cancer production. Plant-based diets also are high in fiber, which has been shown to lower the risk for breast and colorectal cancer.

Plant chemicals
Phytochemicals offer many benefits. In addition to protecting from damage, they decrease inflammation and interrupt processes in the body that encourages cancer production.

Two of the most helpful phytochemicals are:
Antioxidants
This type of phytochemical protects the body from damage. Cancer develops when DNA in cells is damaged. This causes abnormal cells to divide uncontrollably, which can infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cell damage also can be caused by radiation, viruses and exposure to other chemicals. The body's natural metabolism creates oxidants that can cause cell damage, as well. Antioxidants neutralize these damage processes while protecting and restoring cells. Some foods that contain a high level of antioxidants include dark chocolate, apples with the peel, avocados, artichokes, red cabbage, tea, coffee, nuts and grains.
Carotenoids
These are fat-soluble compounds, which means they need to be accompanied by a fat source to be absorbed. Carotenoids are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils and vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, spinach, apricots, green peppers and leafy greens. They are highly pigmented, so look for natural foods that are red, orange, yellow and green. Examples of carotenoids include beta carotene, lycopene, and lutein. They have been linked to reducing the risk of heart disease, cancer, macular degeneration and cataracts.
Many plant-based foods are also high in provitamins called alpha and gamma carotene. When consumed, these vitamins can be converted to vitamin A. This nutrient is important to vision, growth, cell division, reproduction and immunity. Vitamin A also has antioxidant properties.

Nutrients and phytochemicals found in plant-based foods seem to work independently and together to decrease cancer and disease risk. This means that plant-based foods work best when eaten in combination with other foods rather than alone. One prostate cancer study showed that a combination of tomato and broccoli diet was more effective at slowing tumor growth than either tomato or broccoli alone. This demonstrates the power that nutrition has when foods are teamed together.

Plant-based fiber
Plant-based diets are high in natural fiber. This has been shown to reduce cancer risk and moderate insulin levels. Young women who ate the most fiber-rich diets were 25% less likely to get breast cancer later in life, a study found. Other research finds that each 10 grams of daily fiber could lower the risk of colorectal cancer by 10%.

Healthy bacteria in the digestive track can ferment fiber and other starches to produce compounds known to help promote normal colon development and reduce inflammation. These bacteria convert some phytochemicals to more useable or active forms.

Eat for color, variety
There are many delicious options in a plant-based diet. Experiment with new fruits or vegetables, or new ways to incorporate staples.

Cost can be a factor in selecting a plant-based diet menu, as fresh fruits and vegetables may be more expensive. Good alternatives are frozen fruits and vegetables. They are flash-frozen to preserve nutrients and are less expensive. Canned options are available, as well, for people with a stricter budget. Be sure to look for options without added sugar or salt.

Aim to eat at least these amounts in your diet to feel full and get the necessary phytochemicals and fiber:
Fruits, 1.5 to 2.5 cups per day
Vegetables, 2.5 to 4 cups per day
Whole grains, 3 to 5 ounces per day
Legumes, 1.5 cups per week
Protein, 5 to 7 ounces per day. Legumes, dairy, tofu and eggs are excellent sources of protein. Or select lean cuts of meats and avoid processed meats
Fats, 3 to 5 servings per day. One serving equals one teaspoon of oil, four walnut halves or one-sixth of an avocado
Shifting to a plant-based diet
Eating a plant-based diet doesn't need to be all or nothing. Making gradual changes is more sustainable and realistic for most people. Some ways to do this include:
Start your day off right.
Enjoy a delicious and healthy breakfast with whole-grain oatmeal, buckwheat or quinoa, along with fruit, to give you the energy to tackle your day.
Experiment with meatless meals.
Embrace ""meatless Mondays"" and try one new meatless recipe per week.
Treat meat like a condiment.
Instead of using meat as a main dish, use just a little for flavor.
Use legumes for bulk.
Decrease the amount of meat in some recipes by increasing the amount of beans, lentils or vegetables. These foods fill more space on your plate so you won't feel deprived.
Fill your plate with fruits and vegetables first.
Cover about half of your plate with fruits and vegetables for lunch and dinner.
More investigation of foods and their functional components is bound to reveal all that a plant-based diet has to offer. Until then, eating a variety of fruits and veggies prepared in numerous ways will improve your odds for preventing cancer.

"Trying to milk the scientific literature for evidence of a link between dairy consumption and breast cancer can drive one crazy. Is milk protective against this dreaded disease or does it cause it? It depends on which study you happen to read. The latest volley in this battle was fired by researchers from Loma Linda University who concluded that even small amounts of milk, as little as a third of a cup a day, can significantly raise the risk of breast cancer.

This was not some haphazard study. It involved following some 53,000 women who were initially free of breast cancer for eight years. Food frequency questionnaires were filled out at the beginning of the study, and a smaller contingent also periodically filled out twenty-four-hour recall questionnaires that seemed to validate that the whole cohort did not make major dietary changes over the trial period. Eventually, 1057 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, and when the numbers were crunched, the researchers calculated a hazard ratio that ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 depending on the amount of milk consumed.

This means that milk-drinkers were 1.2 to 1.7 times more likely to develop breast cancer over the period of study than non-drinkers. According to cancer statistics, the breast cancer rate in this population is about 3-4% so that with the calculated hazard ratio, roughly 1-2 extra cases of breast cancer would be expected due to drinking a third of a cup to a cup of milk a day. Headlines claiming ""50% increase in breast cancer by drinking a third of a cup of milk a day"" miss the mark because this is a relative risk, not an absolute risk. In other words, an increase in breast cancer incidence from 3 to 4.5% is a 50% increase, but in absolute terms, it means only 1.5 extra cases per one hundred subjects. This is not a huge increase in risk, but it is not insignificant.

The subjects were all Seventh Day Adventists with a large subset consuming either no dairy or little dairy thereby providing a significant group for comparison with the milk drinkers. Soy products were also frequently consumed in this population and were not associated with breast cancer. Substituting these for milk actually offered protection against the disease. The researchers suggested several possible reasons why milk can increase the risk of breast cancer. Since the lactating cows are usually pregnant, they secrete estrogen and progesterone in the milk and these may play a role in triggering hormone-sensitive cancers. Milk also contains insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1, a protein that some studies have implicated as a possible stimulant of cancer cell proliferation.

There is no question that this study was well done. But, and there is always a but, isn't there? The but here is that just a few keystrokes can bring up other studies that also seem to be equally well done but come to the opposite conclusion. In 2015, Chinese researchers analyzed 22 prospective studies involving over 1.5 million subjects as well as five case-control studies with a total of 33,000 subjects and found that when the results were pooled, high and modest milk consumption significantly reduced the risk of breast cancer compared with low dairy consumption. A possible rationale was a protective effect due to calcium. Then in 2019, another meta-analysis of case-control studies, published in the journal, Medicine, found no association between milk consumption and breast cancer.

So, what do we make of these battling studies? Basically, that nutritional research, even if well carried out, cannot account for all confounders and rarely comes to a conclusion that cannot be debated. This is the case not only for dairy consumption but also when it comes to a risk-benefit evaluation for artificial sweeteners, saturated fats, dietary supplements, processed meats, organic foods and a host of other foods or food components. In this case, the subjects were all Seventh Day Adventists whose lifestyle differs considerably from the general population. Many are vegetarians or vegans and eschew processed foods. Adventists drink no alcohol and obesity is very rare. Since alcohol, obesity and processed foods have all been associated with cancer, it is possible that reducing these risk factors allows smaller ones that are masked in the general population to emerge.

Although no observational study can prove a cause and effect relationship, the recent Loma Linda study does ring some alarm bells because of its size and range of milk consumption and call into question the usual recommendation that consumers should drink three glasses of milk a day. Milk is a good source of calcium but there are other foods or supplements that can provide the mineral. It is also noteworthy that breast cancer rates in Japan have increased significantly with an increase in milk consumption since the Second World War.

It should be remembered that in science no single publication should be taken as having the final word, but the Loma Linda study does suggest that the milk-breast cancer link cannot be dismissed. I suspect members of Dairy Associations around the world are going to be in the market for antiperspirants. And no, these do not cause breast cancer.";https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-nutrition/possible-link-between-milk-and-breast-cancer-not-udder-nonsense;trying milk scientific literature evidence link dairy consumption breast cancer drive one crazy . milk protective dreaded disease cause ? depends study happen read . latest volley battle fired researchers loma linda university concluded even small amounts milk , little third cup day , significantly raise risk breast cancer . haphazard study . involved following 53,000 women initially free breast cancer eight years . food frequency questionnaires filled beginning study , smaller contingent also periodically filled twenty-four-hour recall questionnaires seemed validate whole cohort make major dietary changes trial period . eventually , 1057 cases breast cancer diagnosed , numbers crunched , researchers calculated hazard ratio ranged 1.2 1.7 depending amount milk consumed . means milk-drinkers 1.2 1.7 times likely develop breast cancer period study non-drinkers . according cancer statistics , breast cancer rate population 3-4 % calculated hazard ratio , roughly 1-2 extra cases breast cancer would expected due drinking third cup cup milk day . headlines claiming `` 50 % increase breast cancer drinking third cup milk day '' miss mark relative risk , absolute risk . words , increase breast cancer incidence 3 4.5 % 50 % increase , absolute terms , means 1.5 extra cases per one hundred subjects . huge increase risk , insignificant . subjects seventh day adventists large subset consuming either dairy little dairy thereby providing significant group comparison milk drinkers . soy products also frequently consumed population associated breast cancer . substituting milk actually offered protection disease . researchers suggested several possible reasons milk increase risk breast cancer . since lactating cows usually pregnant , secrete estrogen progesterone milk may play role triggering hormone-sensitive cancers . milk also contains insulin-like growth factor 1 , igf-1 , protein studies implicated possible stimulant cancer cell proliferation . question study well done . , always , n't ? keystrokes bring studies also seem equally well done come opposite conclusion . 2015 , chinese researchers analyzed 22 prospective studies involving 1.5 million subjects well five case-control studies total 33,000 subjects found results pooled , high modest milk consumption significantly reduced risk breast cancer compared low dairy consumption . possible rationale protective effect due calcium . 2019 , another meta-analysis case-control studies , published journal , medicine , found association milk consumption breast cancer . , make battling studies ? basically , nutritional research , even well carried , account confounders rarely comes conclusion debated . case dairy consumption also comes risk-benefit evaluation artificial sweeteners , saturated fats , dietary supplements , processed meats , organic foods host foods food components . case , subjects seventh day adventists whose lifestyle differs considerably general population . many vegetarians vegans eschew processed foods . adventists drink alcohol obesity rare . since alcohol , obesity processed foods associated cancer , possible reducing risk factors allows smaller ones masked general population emerge . although observational study prove cause effect relationship , recent loma linda study ring alarm bells size range milk consumption call question usual recommendation consumers drink three glasses milk day . milk good source calcium foods supplements provide mineral . also noteworthy breast cancer rates japan increased significantly increase milk consumption since second world war . remembered science single publication taken final word , loma linda study suggest milk-breast cancer link dismissed . suspect members dairy associations around world going market antiperspirants . , cause breast cancer .
"Abstract
The vegan diet, often known as a plant-rich diet, consists primarily of plant-based meals. This dietary approach may be beneficial to one's health and the environment and is valuable to the immune system. Plants provide vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and antioxidants, components that promote cell survival and immune function, allowing its defensive mechanisms to work effectively. The term ""vegan diet"" comprises a range of eating patterns that prioritize nutrient-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. In comparison to omnivorous diets, which are often lower in such products, the vegan diet has been favorably connected with changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers such as reduced body mass index (BMI) values, total serum cholesterol, serum glucose, inflammation, and blood pressure. Reduced intake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), saturated fat, processed meat, and greater consumption of fiber and phytonutrients may improve cardiovascular health. However, vegans have much smaller amounts of nutrients such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), selenium, zinc, iodine, and vitamin B12, compared to non-vegans, which may lead to detrimental cardiovascular effects. This review aims to present the effect of plant-based diets (PBDs), specifically vegan diets, on the cardiovascular system.
Keywords: vegan diet; plant-based; health benefits; nutrients; cardiovascular health; CVD; risk factors
1. Introduction
Plant-based diets, which include semi-vegetarian and vegetarian diets, emphasize cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts while limiting animal-based foods such as meat, dairy products, and eggs. In a plant-based diet, the level of animal food limitation varies greatly. There are several types of vegetarian diets, such as the vegan diet, which excludes all animal products, including eggs, milk, and milk derivatives, ovo-vegetarians who consume no animal meat or bioproducts besides eggs, and the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, in which eggs, milk, and milk products are included, but no meat is consumed. There are also pescatarians, or people who eat plant-based diets that include dairy and fish [1,2].
Veganism seems to be the most stringent of all the plant-based diets since it excludes all animal-related substances [3]. A whole-food plant-based diet (WFPBD) is another sort of vegan diet that has demonstrated substantial advancements in cardiovascular health, diabetes, and cancer types [4]. More specifically, WFPBD features many fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and natural soy products while eliminating animal products, processed carbs, fat, and sugar.
The long-term impacts of plant-based diets on health outcomes may be difficult to disentangle from plant-based diet-associated behaviors (e.g., regular exercise, avoidance of tobacco and alcohol). However, according to observational research, lower risks of coronary artery disease, obesity, arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and some or perhaps all malignancies are linked with plant-based and vegetarian diets [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Randomized experiments have indicated that vegetarian and especially vegan diets have a positive influence on a variety of cardiovascular (CV) events [13].
The nutritional sufficiency and quality of plant-based and vegetarian diets should be evaluated individually, not based on how they are labeled, but on the type, amount, and diversity of nutrients ingested [14]. For instance, some studies, although not all [15,16], show that vegans may have poorer bone mineral density and a greater fracture risk due to reduced calcium intake. Individuals who follow a vegan diet may also fail to consume sufficient vitamin B12 and require vitamin B12 supplements [17,18]. The aim of this review is to summarize the contemporary evidence regarding the effect of a vegan diet on human health, underline the links between a vegan diet and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including both the positive and negative effects of veganism on the CV system, and provide information regarding the potential therapeutic implications of a vegan diet in CVD.
This article summarizes what is known about the impact of a vegan diet on the cardiovascular system. To the best of our knowledge, our article provides a novel insight into this topic by up-to-date information, detailed tables as well as dynamic and more extensive figures. The effect of a vegan diet on the cardiovascular system is also compared to other diets.
2. Assessment of Vegan Nutrition concerning Health
Vegetarianism and veganism, which are defined in terms of a low frequency of consumption of animal foods, have grown in popularity and exposure over the last decade due to reasons ranging from environmental to animal welfare concerns, as well as possible health advantages. Vegans, whose numbers are rising in high-income countries across the Western world, make up an increasing fraction of the overall population. Moreover, even though the prevalence of vegans in Europe is estimated to be between 1 and 10%, the precise figure varies in each country, since veganism is primarily associated with religious and ethical views, environmental concerns, and cultural and social values [19].
Many health professional organizations have issued statements on vegan diets. Vegan diets should be properly designed and should be able to offer appropriate nourishment throughout life [20,21]. Even though it was once considered risky to be vegan throughout infancy, childhood, pregnancy, and lactation, it is now established that well-planned vegan diets may provide appropriate and balanced nutrition. Yet, the nutrients consumed on a vegan diet are not always beneficial. Vegans, for example, might eat plant-based meals that are heavy in sugar, salt, or harmful fats [22].
Furthermore, according to current data, the protein ratio of daily calorie consumption is greater in omnivores than in vegans [23]. Nevertheless, a well-planned vegan diet can meet general protein needs. Vegans should boost their protein consumption to 10% of their calorie intake [24]. Amino acids determine protein quality. Plant proteins include all necessary amino acids. While one research study found that combining different protein sources for each meal is not necessary if different plant foods are consumed throughout the day [25], other studies show that ingesting grains (methionine) and legumes (lysine) together delivers better effects on the bioavailability of key amino acids [26,27]. Vegan diets meet protein requirements through nuts, grains, seeds, legumes, green leafy vegetables, pseudo cereals (buckwheat, quinoa), soy, and other derivative products [28].
Vegan diets are beneficial in terms of fiber, beta-carotene, vitamin C and K, folic acid, magnesium, and potassium consumption, making them high-quality diets [29]. Such diets are often rich in ?-6 fatty acids as well [30]. Despite these advantages, they usually tend to feature insufficient intake of vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, selenium, zinc, and iodine and fewer accessible ?-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), which can result in energy, nutritional, and micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, supplementation of these nutrients is essential [31]. The recommended daily intake and supplementation of certain micronutrients in a vegan diet are presented in Table 1.

For instance, in a vegan diet, long-chain ?-3 fatty acids, which are critical for retina, brain, and cell membrane function, can only be consumed as a-linolenic acid (ALA), and it is therefore recommended that vegans take an algae-based DHA dietary supplement in addition to regular dietary intake of ALA sources [32]. Most significantly, approximately 5% to 6% of the daily energy requirement in vegan diets should come from saturated fat, mostly tropical or high-fat foods, according to the American Heart Organization [33].
3. Links between a Vegan Diet and Cardiovascular Diseases
3.1. Inflammatory Response as a Result of Unhealthy Dietary Patterns
Chronic Inflammation of the Vessel Walls Due to Unhealthy Diet
The standard diet that has become widely embraced in many countries over the past 40 years is rather unhealthy, containing relatively high amounts of alcohol [34] and processed foods [35], especially those with additives [36], and only a few fruits and vegetables and other meals rich in fiber and prebiotics [37,38]. An unhealthy diet can alter the structure and function of the gut microbiota and has been linked to increased gut permeability [39,40,41] and epigenetic modifications in the immune system [39], which can lead to low-grade endotoxemia and systemic chronic inflammation (SCI) of the vessel walls [39,40,41]. Similarly, foods with a high glycemic index, such as pure sugars and refined grains, which play an important role in most ultra-processed foods, can lead to increased oxidative stress and thus activate inflammatory genes [42].
Within this framework, uncontrolled alcohol consumption that triggers various reactions in the body causes chronic inflammation to increase over time rather than resolve. In the gut, for example, excess alcohol can lead to the proliferation of bacterial waste products, particularly endotoxins, substances that cause inflammation by activating proteins and immune cells. With more endotoxin production, the inflammation worsens instead of improving [40].
Trans fats, which raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and dietary salt (NaCl) are two other components of an unhealthy diet known to be pro-inflammatory. As stated by a recent cohort study of 44,551 French people, a 10 percent increase in the proportion of highly processed food consumption was associated with a 14 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, consistent with the predicted adverse health outcomes of eating foods high in trans fats and sodium [43].
In this context, according to another observational study of 80,082 women in the Nurses' Health Study cohort, it was revealed that higher consumption of trans fats, or to a lesser extent saturated fats, is correlated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), while higher consumption of polyunsaturated (non-hydrogenated) and monounsaturated fats is associated with a reduced risk [44]. The relationship to CHD risk can only partially be explained by the unfavorable effect of trans fats on the lipid profile.
At the same time, in a cross-sectional study of 730 women from the same patient cohort, markers of endothelial activation such as CRP (C-reactive protein), E-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) were higher, suggesting that increased trans fatty acid intake may promote inflammation and adversely affect endothelial function. CRP levels were 73% higher in women in the highest quintile of trans fat intake than in the lowest quintile [45].
Endothelial dysfunction contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall mediated mostly by phagocytic (eating) leukocytes (white blood cells) such as monocytes and macrophages. This initiates a complicated pathogenic cascade that starts with the accumulation of circulating LDL in the subendothelial layer of the arteries [46,47,48,49]. Following an endothelial injury, LDL becomes mildly oxidized [50]. Further oxidation of LDL leads to fully oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), which is then avidly taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors (SR) and ultimately transformed into foam cells (the hallmark of early fatty streak lesions) [51].
The expression and detachment of adhesion glycoproteins on the endothelium regulates leukocyte attachment to endothelial cells. The leukocyte binding to endothelial tissue is mediated by the aforementioned types of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), (VCAM-1), as well as selectins (e.g., P-selectin and E-selectin) [52]. The pathophysiology of endothelial damage and atherosclerosis due to higher LDL levels resulting from an unhealthy diet is illustrated in Figure 1.

Overall, dietary patterns that are high in sugar, alcohol, saturated and trans fatty acids, and refined starches and low in natural antioxidants and fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may activate the innate immune system, most likely through an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines. This imbalance may stimulate the formation of a pro-inflammatory state, which causes endothelial dysfunction at the vascular level, resulting in a predisposition to atherosclerotic plaque formation. This can lead susceptible people to an increased prevalence of CHD.
It is vital to understand that both an unhealthy diet and a vegan diet can initiate chronic inflammation if a vegan diet contains inadequate amounts of essential vitamins and nutrients as well as omega-3 fatty acids [31].
3.2. Benefits/Risks of a Vegan Diet for the Cardiovascular System
CVD is the leading cause of mortality, currently accounting for one-third of all deaths worldwide and growing in prevalence. Examples of CVDs include CHD, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic and congenital heart disease, and venous thromboembolism. In this context, vegan diets are considered to improve health and decrease the risk of CVD. On the other hand, according to some studies, a vegan diet may be related to reduced intake of protein, vitamins, or minerals, and thus should also be evaluated in terms of harmful effects. The research on veganism is contradictory and inadequately evaluated [53]. The vast majority of studies on health effects of vegan and plant-based diets were short term and cannot give accurate data on cardiovascular outcomes, which has mostly been estimated based on the changes in biomarker concentrations. More studies with hard endpoints such as major adverse cardiovascular events are required to fully understand the effects of vegan and vegetarian diet on the cardiovascular system. The potential positive and negative impacts of a vegan diet on the CV system discussed in the following paragraphs are shown in Figure 2.

3.2.1. The Positive Effects of Veganism on the Cardiovascular System
PBDs, especially vegan diets, have been shown to provide several health benefits [54]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the benefits of a vegan diet on human health are due to increased daily consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, nuts, legumes, and seeds, indicating that vegans make healthier lifestyle choices than those who follow other dietary patterns [55]. Some of the potential health merits include a decreased rate of certain conditions, such as CVD. Vegan diets have been reported to be low-risk therapies for decreasing BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and LDL levels, minimizing the incidence of coronary heart disease events by 40% [56].
Additionally, the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies, which were eventually drawn from the analyses of only two studies, indicated that greater adherence to the PBDs was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (10%) (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99; I2 = 90.7%, pheterogeneity < 0.001), and CHD mortality (23%). Based on the same study, it was also found that among vegan diets, compliance with a usual vegetarian diet might protect against CVD and CHD mortality [57].
Because of its low saturated fatty acid (SFAs) and high fiber content, the vegan diet is characterized by low energy intake. Dietary fibers are a diverse group of plant molecules (carbohydrate polymers with ten or more monomer units) with varying physical and chemical characteristics [58]. Water-soluble (SFs) and insoluble fibers (IFs) are the two most common types. Because these fibers are not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes, they are not completely digested in the human gut [59]. They alter intestinal function by regulating intestinal motions, increasing fecal bulk, and avoiding constipation, among other things. SF, for instance, dissolves in water and forms thick solutions (gels) in the intestinal lumen, delaying or partially reducing carbohydrate, lipid, and cholesterol absorption. These viscous gels can also delay emptying of the stomach and prolong food absorption, enhancing satiety and altering insulin and glycemic post-prandial responses [60].
Moreover, we know that meals of vegetable origin are high in polyphenols, which are natural bioactive chemicals generated by plants as secondary metabolites [61]. Polyphenols may also benefit CV health by inhibiting platelet aggregation, reducing inflammation of the vessel walls, modulating apoptotic processes, lowering LDL oxidation, and improving the lipid profile [62]. Several in vitro investigations have revealed that polyphenols have a high antioxidant capacity due to their ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). Their antioxidant properties, presumably paired with their ability to modify nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, allow them to protect endothelial function [63].
Other antioxidant minerals found in a vegan diet include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, potassium, and magnesium. Potassium has been proven to decrease blood pressure and the risk of stroke due to its favorable effects on endothelial function and vascular homeostasis [64]. Furthermore, magnesium has been linked to better cardiometabolic outcomes due to its effect on glucose metabolism as well as its anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and antiarrhythmic characteristics [65].
The influence on cholesterol metabolism is another important way that a vegan diet might benefit CV health. The low SFA concentration and high unsaturated fat content can enhance the lipid profile. SFAs have been found to activate the pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, resulting in the production of cytokines capable of triggering a chronic inflammatory state [66,67]. SFAs can also interact with the gut microbiota by facilitating the transfer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a powerful endotoxin, a mediator of systemic inflammation, and a driver of septic shock [68].
Various studies, however, have revealed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate several anti-inflammatory pathways. As a result, a diet high in unsaturated fats and low in SFAs can lower the risk of CVDs through its potential anti-inflammatory effects [69,70].
A meta-analysis of observational studies that compared the vegan diets to omnivorous diets observed that the vegan diet has less energy and saturated fat as a result it protects against cardiometabolic conditions. The authors discovered a decrease in fasting blood glucose and BMI and an improvement in the lipid profile [71].
3.2.2. The Negative Effect of Veganism on the Cardiovascular System
In contrast, lower intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., DHA and EPA), vitamins (i.e., vitamin B12 and D), specific nutrients, including selenium, zinc, iodine, and calcium, as well as higher levels of essential amino acids (i.e., homocysteine), may explain some of the unfavorable CV effects associated with vegan diets, such as the potential increased risk of ischemic stroke [72]. One study has found that vegans and vegetarians had a higher risk of ischemic stroke than people who ate animal products (HR, 1.54; 95 percent CI, 0.95–2.48) [53].
Nevertheless, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that compared vegetarians and vegans to nonvegetarians has shown no clear association with stroke or subtypes of stroke for vegans and vegetarians [73,74]. At the same time and as specified by a meta-analysis, with a large-scale study design of 657,433 participants, the incidence of total stroke was lower among vegetarians in studies conducted in Asia than nonvegetarians (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.45–0.95; I2 = 54%, n = 3). Furthermore, the same review found that although there is no strong association between vegetarian diets and a reduced risk of stroke in young adults, there is evidence that older participants aged 50–65 years following a vegetarian pattern exhibited a lower incidence of stroke than nonvegetarians [74].
Although a plant-based diet and especially a vegan diet is believed to be healthy, it can nonetheless result in a higher level of essential amino acids. The most important molecule in this study is homocysteine (Hcy), which has been identified as a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease and hypercoagulability. Given that, there is evidence of a link between hyperhomocysteinemia arising from a vegan diet and CVD, such as heart attacks and strokes [75].
In this regard, and as previously stated, while plant foods provide various nutrients, including dietary fiber and phytochemicals, they do not contain enough vitamin B12 to meet the needs of their consumers, leading to severe deficiency. Deficiency in vitamin B12 will eventually result in hyperhomocysteinemia [76]. Subsequently, because it lowers vascular flexibility and alters homeostasis, elevated homocysteine will induce vascular endothelial impairment. It may also aggravate the negative consequences of risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, and lipoprotein metabolism [77]. Most critically, Hcy has been recognized as a significant CVD risk factor [78].
Besides causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by avoiding animal-based meals can also contribute to an increased risk of cardiac conditions via its function in macrocytosis [79]. To be more specific, a deficiency in vitamin B12 can increase the risk of macrocytic anemia, a condition arising from the abnormal growth of red blood cells. In this way, it leads to various diseases, such as heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease, and stroke. It can additionally decrease oxygen delivery and the carrying capacity of blood vessels, undermining circulation's primary role.
Similarly, vitamin D deficiency, which can be caused by veganism, increases the risk of CVD and is linked to other well-known risk factors for heart diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes [80,81,82]. In particular, low levels of the vitamin may initially predispose the body to congestive heart failure and chronic blood vessel inflammation (associated with hardening of the arteries). It might also change hormone levels, increasing insulin resistance and thus raising the risk of diabetes [83].
To date, certain cross-sectional studies have connected vitamin D deficiency to an increased risk of CVD, such as hypertension, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease [84]. Simultaneously, other prospective studies have found that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of incident hypertension or sudden cardiac death in individuals who already have CVD [83].
Not only vitamin deficiencies, but other dietary components found in vegan diets can promote an inflammatory response and hence contribute to the development of chronic inflammation [6,85]. These include micronutrient deficiencies, such as zinc and selenium, caused by eating processed or refined foods low in vitamins and minerals, as well as insufficient omega-3 levels, notably EPA and DHA, which impact the resolution phase of inflammation. Eventually, inflammation will induce an atherogenic response, resulting in serious health problems, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and CHD [86].
4. Therapeutic Implications
CVD prevention is a major public health concern. It has long been known that vegetarians, and specifically vegans, experience occurrences of chronic CVD, including ischemic heart disease, less frequently [87]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that incidences of risk factors and comorbidities such as angina and heart failure, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity, as well as hypertension, can be reduced due to a plant-based diet [56,88]. Even in cases of endothelial damage, a vegan diet is beneficial in slowing or stopping the advancement of coronary atheroma [11,89,90]. These observations have sparked an investigation into the possibility of adopting a vegan diet as a therapeutic tool in preventing or treating CVDs. A summary of clinical studies evaluating relevant outcomes associated with the CV system in patients following a vegan diet is shown in Table 2.

The Role of a Vegan Diet in the Prevention of CVD
As reported by evidence from interventional trials, a low-fat vegetarian and vegan diet has been effective in treating coronary artery disease (CAD) for over 45 years. Research has suggested that a well-planned plant-based diet is equally as successful at lowering cholesterol as statin medications and a highly advantageous alternative to other treatment strategies [102]. At the same time, it has the distinct benefits of having no side effects or contraindications, is affordable, and has high patient compliance [103].
As aforementioned, vegetarians, particularly vegans, have a decreased incidence of hypercholesterolemia, primarily total and LDL cholesterol [104]. The chief reason for this is that they have increased insulin sensitivity and thus lowered cholesterol production [105]. The fact that vegans have lower cholesterol levels indicates a reduction in the risk of atherogenesis, and consequently CAD. Furthermore, due to their efficiency in eliminating potentially atherogenic remnants, the metabolisms of vegans have been discovered to have superior control of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [106], thereby exerting protective effects against obesity and the incidence of diabetes.
A study that compared the weight change between patients on a Mediterranean diet and those on a vegan diet discovered that the vegan diet resulted in a 6.0 kg decrease in mean body weight, compared to no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect 6.0 kg (95% CI 7.5 to 4.5); p 0.001). Most of the weight loss during the vegan diet was due to the decline in fat mass and visceral fat volume (treatment effect 3.4 kg (95% CI 4.7 to 2.2); p 0.001; and 314.5 cm3 (95% CI 446.7 to 182.4); p 0.001, respectively). In the end, of the 52 study participants, only 26 lost weight on the Mediterranean diet, compared to 48 following the vegan diet [107].
Meanwhile, a recent case report described the effects of a plant-based diet on a 79-year-old patient with diagnosed triple vessel disease (80–95% narrowing) and left ventricular systolic failure (ejection fraction = 35%), all in the setting of worsening dyspnea. Two months on a plant-based diet resulted in clinically significant weight and cholesterol reductions, as well as enhanced exercise tolerance and ejection fraction (+15%) [108]. Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that vegan diets enhance glycemic management, with substantial reductions in HbA1c levels [109], lowering the chance of developing type 2 diabetes.
Likewise, a systematic review, which assessed how effective the PBDs are for treating obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes, stated that plant-based diets demonstrate improved weight control and cardiometabolic outcomes related to lipids, cardiovascular end points, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, A1C, and fasting glucose, and a lower risk of diabetes compared with usual diets and in some cases standard health-oriented diets such as the American Heart Association (AHA), American Diabetic Association (ADA), and Mediterranean diets. This study suggested that plant-predominant diets practiced as part of sustained lifestyle interventions can stabilize or even reverse DM 2 and CVD [110].
The impact of a vegan diet on blood pressure is important because arterial hypertension is the most common CVD risk factor [111]. The study by Pettersen et al. showed that vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians, and partial vegetarians had lower estimated odds of arterial hypertension (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.19–0.74; OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36–0.92 and OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.50–1.70) than non-vegetarians [112]. In a meta-analysis by Gibbs et al., a vegan diet was not significantly associated with systolic blood pressure (?1.30 mmHg; 95% CI: ?3.90,1.29) [113]. In addition, in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials by Termannsen et al., no significant effect of a vegan diet on blood pressure was found [114]. In a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials by Lopez et al., more optimistic results were obtained. A vegan diet was found to significantly reduce systolic (?4.10 mmHg; 95% CI: ? 8.14 to ? 0.06) and diastolic (?4.01 mmHg; 95% CI: ?5.97 to ?2.05) blood pressure in subjects with baseline systolic blood pressure ? 130 mmHg. In subjects with baseline systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg, no significant antihypertensive effect of a vegan diet was observed [115]. The results of these studies indicate that the adoption of a vegan diet should be seen as more important in supporting the treatment, rather than the prevention, of arterial hypertension.
Exercise and weight loss are first-line treatments for hypertension at all stages. However, a cross-sectional study indicated that a vegan diet is the most important intervention. This study compared the blood pressure of inactive vegans, endurance athletes consuming a Western diet and running an average of 48 miles per week, and inactive participants that were only consuming a Western diet. Based on the findings of the study, blood pressure was remarkably lower in the vegan group [54].
The positive results associated with the preceding study are most likely attributable to the abundance of antioxidant minerals prevalent in a vegan diet, such as magnesium and potassium. Because of their beneficial effects on endothelial function, and their antiarrhythmic and vasodilatory properties, both potassium and magnesium have been proven to lower blood pressure and thus contribute to the electrical stability of the heart, resulting in better cardiometabolic outcomes [65].
At this point, it is crucial to indicate some of the characteristics and potential differences between pure veganism and other diets with regard to cardiovascular effects. The main differences are shown in Table 3.

5. Outlook and Conclusions
PBDs, particularly vegan diets, which exclude all animal-based foods, reflect a feeding pattern that groups have followed for many years, primarily for ethical, ideological, and environmental reasons [19]. Extensive research has been carried out to show the positive as well as negative impacts of a vegan diet on the CV system. Vegan diets are thought to improve health and reduce the risk of CVDs, including CAD, arrhythmias, and heart failure [53]. However, according to some studies, a vegan diet may be associated with lower intake of protein, vitamins, or minerals [116], inducing chronic inflammation and, thus, an atherogenic response.
Finally, a vegan diet is mostly used to improve body weight and composition [117]. Accordingly, this dietary pattern seems to be a feasible and reliable approach to preventing and treating CVD and its risk factors [53] since it minimizes the risk of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and CAD, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Especially considering that CAD is such a widespread cause of disability and mortality [118], a well-planned vegan diet combined with appropriate nutritional supplementation might be considered preventative for patients at high CVD risk.";https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/10/3/94;"abstract vegan diet , often known plant-rich diet , consists primarily plant-based meals . dietary approach may

"Vitamin C is a vital nutrient for health. Vitamin C benefits include helping form and maintain bones, cartilage, skin, and blood vessels. As an antioxidant, it also supports the immune system.

Fruits and vegetables are the best sources, but some people may need supplements.

Vitamin C occurs naturally in some foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C supplements are also available.

Other names for vitamin C include L-ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid, and L-ascorbate.

In this article, learn more about why we need vitamin C, how much we need, and where to find it.

Why we need vitamin C
Vitamin C is water soluble, and the body does not store it. To maintain adequate levels of vitamin C, people need to consume food that contains it every day.

The body needs vitamin C for various functions. Here are some of them:

It helps the body produce collagen, L-carnitine, and some neurotransmitters.
As an antioxidant, it helps remove unwanted substances known as reactive oxidative species (ROS) from the body.
It helps the body absorb iron.
It boosts the immune system.
It enhances wound healing.
ROS are substances such as free radicals that result from natural bodily processes, exposure to pollution, and other factors. They can lead to oxidative stress, which can, in turn, cause cell damage.

Vitamin C's antioxidant activity may help reduce inflammation and lower the risk of developing various conditions, including some cancers.

The body needs vitamin C to produce collagen. This is the main component of connective tissue and makes up 1–2% of muscle tissue.

Collagen is a vital component in fibrous tissues such as:

tendons
ligaments
skin
the cornea
cartilage
bones
the gut
blood vessels
Low levels of vitamin C in the body can lead to scurvy. Symptoms of scurvy include swollen joints, bleeding gums and loose teeth, anemia, and tiredness.

Benefits
The benefits of vitamin C may include the following.

Wound healing
Vitamin C helps the body produce collagen and is present in skin, muscle, and other tissues.

People with a low intake of vitamin C may experience slower wound healing, as their bodies will be less able to produce collagen.

During times of recovery, healthcare professionals may recommendTrusted Source supplements for people with low vitamin C levels.

Cardiovascular health
Vitamin C may benefitTrusted Source cardiovascular health for several reasons. Studies have suggested that it may:

have antioxidant properties
help widen the blood vessels
improve nitric oxide production
help reduce plaque instability in atherosclerosis
This could help protect against heart disease and hypertension, or high blood pressure.

However, there is not enough evidenceTrusted Source to suggest that taking supplements will help protect heart health.

Cataracts and age-related macular degeneration
Vitamin C may help lowerTrusted Source the risk of cataracts and slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration. However, more research is needed.

Experts believe that oxidative stress may be a factor in both conditions, so any benefit may be due to vitamin C's antioxidant activity.

Diabetes
A 2019 studyTrusted Source looked at 31 people aged around 60 years to see whether or not taking vitamin C supplements made a difference to their glucose levels after eating.

After taking supplements for 4 months, the participants' glucose levels and blood pressure improved, compared with taking a placebo. This suggests that vitamin C could, one day, be a treatment for diabetes.

Anemia
Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron, and some healthcare professionals recommend taking vitamin C supplements with iron tablets to improve absorption in people with iron deficiency anemia.

One 2020 studyTrusted Source looked at 432 people who took iron supplements for iron deficiency anemia. Some took vitamin C with their iron supplement, and others did not.

However, both groups saw similar increases in iron, suggesting that vitamin C supplementation is unnecessary for this purpose.

Pollution
Air pollution consists of various substances and chemicals that can have a negative impact on people's health.

Some researchTrusted Source has suggested that a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E may have an antioxidant effect that can help reduce symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Allergies
During an allergic reaction, the immune system triggers an inflammatory response that can lead to symptoms such as swelling and hives. During this process, the body produces ROS, which can lead to oxidative stress.

In a 2018 studyTrusted Source, 71 people with skin or respiratory allergies received various doses of intravenous vitamin C, and the researchers observed the severity of the participants' symptoms. Their paper concludes that taking a high dose of vitamin C may help reduce allergy symptoms.

They also found evidence to suggest that low vitamin C levels were common in people with allergies.

Motion sickness
In a 2014 studyTrusted Source, 70 people took 2 grams of either vitamin C or a placebo and then spent 20 minutes on a life raft in a wave pool. Those who took the supplement had lower levels of seasickness.

Can vitamin C help treat the common cold?
Many people believe that vitamin C can cure a common cold, but research has not confirmedTrusted Source this.

However, taking dosages of 200 milligrams (mg) or more per day may benefit people who:

participate in extreme physical activity
have exposure to cold temperatures
have low vitamin C levels due to smoking

Vitamin C and cancer therapy
Vitamin C may help treat cancer, though experts have not confirmed this.

As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects the body from oxidative stress, which can occur when ROS levels are high. Oxidative stress can lead to cell damage and may play a role in some cancers.

A 2015 mouse studyTrusted Source found that taking high doses of vitamin C may slow the growth of some types of cancerous tissue. The paper suggests that vitamin C could, one day, become a new treatment for colorectal cancer.

Also, the authors of a 2013 reviewTrusted Source suggest that vitamin C might work well alongside other treatments to benefit people with cancer.

The National Cancer InstituteTrusted Source note that some alternative therapists already use intravenous vitamin C when treating cancer, fatigue, and infections. However, they note that more research is necessary.

Intravenous vitamin C does not currently have approvalTrusted Source from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat cancer.

Requirements
The Office for Dietary SupplementsTrusted Source advise people to consume the following recommended daily allowances (RDA) of vitamin C per day:

Age	Sex	RDA (mg)
0–6 months	any	40
7–12 months	any	50
1–3 years	any	15
4–8 years	any	25
9–13 years	any	45
14–18 years	male	75
14–18 years	female	65
19+ years	male	90
19+ years	female	75
Additional vitamin C is necessary during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.

Sources
The best sources of vitamin C are fresh fruits and vegetables. However, heat and cooking in water can destroy some of the vitamin C content in these foods, so eating raw foods is best.

Some good sources of vitamin C include:

red and green peppers
oranges and orange juice
grapefruit
kiwifruit
strawberries
spinach and other green, leafy vegetables
tomatoes
potatoes
green peas

Who is at risk of deficiency?
Those at risk of vitamin C deficiency includeTrusted Source:

people who smoke or have exposure to secondhand smoke
infants who consume only evaporated or boiled milk
people who do not consume a varied diet
people with certain health conditions, especially those that involve intestinal malabsorption

Do people who smoke need more vitamin C?
Smoking and having exposure to other pollutants can lead to oxidative stress. Antioxidants, such as vitamin C, can help reduce oxidative stress.

People who smoke tend to have lower levels of vitamin C than people who do not smoke. This may be due to having higher levels of oxidative stress.

Smoking also causes inflammation and damage to the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and lungs.

Vitamin C is necessary for healthy mucosa and helps reduce inflammation, so the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that people who smoke consume an extra 35 mgTrusted Source of vitamin C each day.

How much is too much?
The recommended maximum intake of vitamin C for adults is 2,000 mg per dayTrusted Source.

Taking too much vitamin C is unlikely to cause any significant problems, but if a person consumes more than 1,000 mg of vitamin C per day, they will not absorb it all. This may lead to diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort.

People are unlikely to consume too much through their diet, and their bodies cannot store it. However, having a high intake through supplements may result in kidney stones.

This may also increase the risk of cardiovascular problems in females after menopause, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this.

People with hereditary hemochromatosis, which is an iron absorption disorder, should talk to their healthcare professional before taking vitamin C supplements. Having high vitamin C levels could lead to tissue damage.

Summary
Vitamin C is an antioxidant and essential nutrient that has many functions. For example, it helps produce collagen, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance wound healing.

Fresh fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C.

"Abstract
Purpose of Review
Although plant-based diets are recommended for cancer prevention, their role in cancer survival is still uncertain. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the association between postdiagnosis plant-based diets and prognosis in cancer survivors.

Recent Findings
There is indication that higher intake of plant-based foods was associated with improved prognosis in cancer survivors. For colorectal cancer survival, a better prognosis was observed for a high intake of whole grains and fibre. For breast cancer survival, a higher intake of fruit, vegetable and fibre and a moderate intake of soy/isoflavone were associated with beneficial outcomes. A higher vegetable fat intake was related to improved prognosis in prostate cancer survivors.

Summary
Emerging evidence suggests benefits of postdiagnosis plant-based diets on prognosis in cancer survivors. However, given the high heterogeneity between studies, further research in cancer survivors, considering clinical factors (e.g. treatment, stage) and methodological aspects (e.g. timing of dietary assessment), is needed.

Keywords: Cancer survival, Cancer prognosis, Plant-based diets, Whole grain, Vegetable, Nuts

Introduction
Due to rising cancer incidence worldwide combined with improved survival rates especially in high-income countries as a result of advances in treatment and early detection in the past decades, the number of people living with or after cancer is growing [1]. According to current estimates, there were 50.5 million people living with cancer in 2020 who had been diagnosed within the last 5 years, and this number is projected to further increase in the next years [2]. A cancer diagnosis is recognized as a ""teachable moment"" [3] and is frequently observed to trigger lifestyle changes, including changes in dietary habits, in hope of improving cancer prognosis and overall health [4-6]. To date, however, there are no specific recommendations, and cancer prevention recommendations for the general population are applied to cancer survivors, although they may represent a specific target group with different nutritional needs and metabolic functions [7, 8]. Plant-based diets are an integral part of evidence-based recommendations for primary prevention of cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), promoting a diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes and a limited consumption of red and processed meat [9]. As cancer survivors are at elevated risk of premature death mainly due to their primary cancer, but also due to second primary cancers and other comorbidities, such as coronary heart disease, obesity and diabetes mellitus, these guidelines might be even more important to them than for people without a history of cancer [10]. Recent studies have investigated associations between dietary factors and survival or prognosis of various cancers, and findings indicated beneficial outcomes for higher intake of plant-based diets and components in cancer survivors [11••, 12•, 13•, 14••, 15•, 16]. In this context, it is important to consider several aspects, including the timing of dietary assessment (e.g. assessment after cancer diagnosis?=?postdiagnostic diet), different cancer sites (e.g. breast, colorectal, prostate cancer) and specific prognostic outcomes, such as cancer-specific mortality, recurrence or overall survival. To provide an overview on this topic, we conducted a systematic review of recently published meta-analyses and prospective studies investigating the association between postdiagnostic plant-based diets and overall and site-specific cancer prognosis.

Search Strategy and Study Selection
We conducted a systematic search of the recently published literature on the association between postdiagnosis plant-based diets and foods with cancer prognosis in individuals after a cancer diagnosis in PubMed from January 1, 2015 to November 9, 2021. We did not apply any restrictions or filters and used predefined search terms. We used MeSH terms and title/abstract text words related to plant-based dietary patterns (i.e. vegan, vegetarian, plant-based), food groups and foods (i.e. fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, plant oils, vegetable products, soya, olive oil, tofu), nutrients or other bioactive compounds (i.e. plant protein, folate, carotenoids, polyphenols, isoflavones, glucosinolates, fibre) and cancer (i.e. cancer tumour, carcinoma), combined with prognostic outcomes (i.e. prognosis, overall survival, all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality/survival, recurrence), related to the study population (i.e. cancer survivors) and the study design (i.e. prospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses). We excluded cross-sectional and retrospective case-control studies as well as studies on prediagnosis diet. Screening of studies was conducted by at least two independent researchers. The reference lists of selected articles were additionally hand-searched for relevant literature.

Search Results
In total, 30 studies (seven meta-analyses and 23 primary studies) met our inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Five of the 23 recently published primary studies were already considered in the identified meta-analyses, and the remaining 18 primary studies were additionally identified through the systematic literature search (Table ?(Table1).1). Of the seven meta-analyses [7, 17, 18, 19••, 20••, 21, 22••], five focused on breast cancer (BC) [17, 18, 20••, 21, 22••], one on colorectal cancer (CRC) [19••] and one on overall cancer [7]. The meta-analysis on overall cancer included prospective cohort studies (Table ?(Table11).

Of 23 eligible primary studies [11••, 12•, 13•, 14••, 15•, 16, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 27•, 28, 29, 30•, 31•, 32-39], two articles were found by manual literature search [26, 28]. The articles were mainly related to BC prognosis [11••, 13•, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 27•, 28, 29, 30•, 31•], followed by CRC prognosis [12•, 14••, 15•, 32-36] and PC prognosis [16, 37-39]. This was to be expected, as these common cancer sites have high 5-year survival rates, and diet is already known to be an important factor for the prevention of these cancers. General characteristics of eligible primary studies are summarized in .

Table ?Table2.2. The majority of studies was conducted in North America/USA [11••, 12•, 13•, 15•, 16, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31•, 32, 34-38], three studies in Germany [14••, 27•, 33], one in Denmark [23], one in England [39] and two in China [25•, 30•]. All identified studies were prospective cohort studies using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models, with time since dietary assessment as the underlying time scale. Most studies (n?=?20) investigated all-cause mortality/overall survival [11••, 12•, 13•, 14••, 15•, 16, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 27•, 28, 29, 30•, 31•, 32-35, 37], 14 studies examined cancer-specific mortality [11••, 13•, 15•, 16, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 27•, 28, 33, 34, 37, 38], and eight studies analysed cancer recurrence [11••, 16, 23, 25•, 26, 27•, 33, 39]. Combined endpoints, including recurrence-free and disease-free survival, were addressed in two [12•, 32] and seven studies [12•, 16, 30•, 32, 33, 35, 36], respectively. All included studies verified cancer diagnosis and validated outcomes of prognosis. Dietary information was mainly assessed at least 1 year after diagnosis [11••, 13•, 14••, 15•, 24, 26, 27•, 28, 29, 30•, 31•, 32, 34, 37-39], two studies [25•, 33] assessed early-postdiagnosis diet (2-3 months after diagnosis) and three assessed diet during active chemotherapy [12•, 35, 36]. Among the 23 eligible primary studies, four studies [14••, 27•, 30•, 37] explicitly focussed on long-term cancer survivors, with exposure assessment at least 5 years after cancer diagnosis. Dietary assessment was conducted via validated FFQs in all studies except three biomarker studies that used blood samples for exposure assessment, investigating circulating phytoestrogen metabolites [27•] and folate [29] in association with BC prognosis and serum genistein and luteolin concentrations [33] in relation to CRC prognosis. Repeated dietary assessment at multiple time points was conducted by 14 studies [11••, 12•, 13•, 15•, 16, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 32, 34-36, 38], with dietary intakes being studied as cumulative average values. Moreover, five studies [13•, 15•, 16, 23, 28] considered changes in dietary intake between pre- and postdiagnosis assessments. Adjustment for prediagnostic intake of the exposure of interest was reported in four studies [13•, 15•, 23, 34]. Dietary intakes assessed via FFQ were adjusted for total energy intake [11••, 12•, 13•, 14••, 15•, 16, 23, 24, 25•, 26, 28, 30•, 31•, 32, 34-39] and selected clinical prognostic, lifestyle and socio-demographic factors. All studies considered aspects of cancer stage, but some studies did not assess information on cancer treatment [11••, 15•, 23, 34] or relied on self-reports [13•, 14••, 24, 26, 28, 31•]. All studies considered age at diagnosis/at dietary assessment as a covariate and nine studies [13•, 16, 23, 24, 26, 27•, 33, 34, 37] adjusted for time between diagnosis and dietary assessment. Four studies [16, 30•, 33, 38] adjusted for further comorbidities.

Association Between Plant-Based Diets and Overall Cancer Prognosis
One meta-analysis on intake of fruit (n?=?3) and vegetables (n?=?4) regarding all-cause mortality in survivors of different cancer sites was identified [7]. No clear associations were observed (Table ?(Table11).

Association Between Plant-Based Diets and Breast Cancer Prognosis
For BC prognosis, we identified meta-analyses on fruit and vegetable, carotenoid and fibre intake regarding overall survival (Table ?(Table1).1). There was no indication for an association between fruit and vegetable intake with overall survival of BC (summary hazards ratio and 95% confidence interval (SHR (95% CI)) for high vs. low intake of fruit and vegetable combined: 0.95 (0.73, 1.24); I2?=?17%, n?=?2)). Similar associations were observed for overall survival when investigating fruit and vegetable separately (SHR (95% CI) for high fruit intake: 1.04; (0.77, 1.42); I2?=?41%; n?=?3; and for high vegetable intake: 1.08 (0.75, 1.55); I2?=?60%; n?=?3). A meta-analysis on cruciferous vegetable intake and overall survival also did not show an association (SHR (95% CI): 1.03 (0.90, 1.17); I2?=?0%; n?=?2) [17]. In line with this observation, another meta-analysis did not find an association between carotenoid intake (a proxy for fruit and vegetable intake) and overall- or BC-specific survival [18] (Table ?(Table1).1). However, a recent meta-analysis by Jayedi et al. [20••] identified an association between higher fibre intake and improved BC prognosis (SHR (95% CI): for all-cause mortality: 0.70 (0.55, 0.89); I2?=?0%; n?=?3 and for BC-mortality: 0.72 (0.51, 1.01); I2?=?0%; n?=?3] [20••]. Due to their oestrogen-like effects, soy/isoflavones are of particular interest for BC prognosis and showed a tendency (but imprecisely estimated) towards better overall survival in a high vs. low meta-analysis (SHR (95% CI): 0.80; (0.62,1.04); I2?=?24%; n?=?2) [22••]. In that systematic review, single study findings indicated that higher postdiagnostic soy and isoflavone intake tended to be inversely associated with BC-specific mortality (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (HR (95% CI)): 0.83 (0.64, 1.07)) and a decreased relative risk of recurrence (HR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.61, 0.92)) among both US and Chinese women [40].

Regarding plant-based dietary patterns, one US prospective cohort study was identified examining the association between long-term adherence to an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful PDI (hPDI) and an unhealthful PDI (uPDI) regarding BC prognosis. While for the overall PDI no associations could be observed, the hPDI was associated with a 7% reduced relative risk of all-cause death (HR (95% CI): 0.93 (0.83,1.05)) and a 17% lower relative risk of death due to other causes than BC (HR (95% CI): 0.83 (0.71,0.98)). Conversely, the uPDI was associated with increased relative risks of all-cause death and death due to other causes than BC (HR (95% CI): 1.07 (0.96, 1.20) and 1.20 (1.02, 1.41), respectively). No associations were observed between plant-based eating patterns and BC-specific endpoints [11••].

In the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS and NHS II), women with cumulative average of postdiagnostic high fruit and vegetable intake had a decreased relative risk of all-cause mortality (HR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.71, 0.94)) (Table ?(Table2).2). Results indicated that especially a higher vegetable intake was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR (95% CI): 0.84 (0.72, 0.97)), while no association was observed for fruit intake. Subgroup analyses also pointed to lower all-cause mortality risk with higher intake of cruciferous vegetables (HR (95% CI): 0.87 (0.76, 0.99)) and vegetables high in ?-carotene (HR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.70, 0.91)). Findings from the NHS study cohorts provided further evidence that BC survivors should be encouraged to maintain a high intake of fruit and vegetables after diagnosis, as a decrease in total fruit and vegetable intake, or vegetables alone, by one or more servings/day from pre- to postdiagnosis was associated with a 14% (HR (95% CI): 1.14 (1.01-1.27)) and a 16% (HR (95% CI): 1.16 (1.02-1.30)) higher relative risk of all-cause mortality [13•]. Other studies did not find an association between fruit and vegetable consumption or whole grain intake and BC prognosis [23, 28]. A recently published study from China showed that nut consumption was associated with an up to 50% reduced relative risk of BC recurrence, metastasis or mortality. Total nut intake???17 g/week, compared to non-consumption, was inversely associated with overall survival (OS) (HR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.52, 1.05)) and disease-free survival (DFS) (0.48 (0.31, 0.73)). Stratified analyses showed that the association was more evident among participants with a higher total energy intake for OS and among participants with early stage (I-II) BC for DFS. The associations did not vary according to nut type (i.e. peanuts, walnuts, other nuts) [30•].

No association with BC prognosis was observed for plant-based protein, whereas a modest survival benefit was reported for total protein intake [26]. Recently, it has been shown that high postdiagnostic intakes of total carbohydrates (CHO) were associated with higher relative risk of BC-specific and all-cause mortality [41]. However, a recent study suggested that the sources of CHO might have different effects on BC prognosis [24]. While higher intake of CHO from vegetables was associated with a decreased mortality risk (HR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.75, 0.97)), CHO from fruit juices, refined grains or potatoes were associated with increased relative risk (HR (95% CI) for CHO from fruit juice: 1.15 (1.01, 1.30); for CHO from refined grains: 1.16 (1.02, 1.32); and for CHO from potatoes: 1.13 (0.99, 1.28)). Similar associations were observed for BC-specific mortality (Table ?(Table22).

Addressing the controversially discussed association between soy/isoflavone intake and BC prognosis, a recently published study indicated that a higher postdiagnostic dietary intake of isoflavone was associated with reduced all-cause mortality following a linear dose-response trend. The strongest association was observed for???1.5 compared to?<?0.3 mg/d (HR (95% CI): 0.65 (0.41, 1.00)). In subgroup analyses, the association was stronger for women with ER-PR-tumours and women who did not receive hormone therapy in the past [31]. A study from Hong Kong reported favourable associations with prognostic outcomes only for moderate intake of soy isoflavone, but not for the highest intake [25•]. This association was stronger in pre-menopausal women, women with triple-negative tumours and women who received initial hormone treatment [25•]. Since the mean soy isoflavone intake of this Chinese study cohort was 8.5 mg/d in the early postdiagnosis period, moderate intake here may be comparable to a high intake in the North American population (mean intake of 1.8 mg/d) [31].

Results of a biomarker study from Germany of long-term postmenopausal BC survivors did not point to a clear overall relationship between circulating phytoestrogen metabolites in the blood and prognosis. However, there were some surprising findings on individual phytoestrogen metabolites: Higher concentrations of luteolin were associated with an increased relative risk of BC-specific mortality. In addition, higher concentrations of genistein and resveratrol were associated with a higher relative risk of BC recurrence [27•]. Another biomarker study indicated that higher circulating folate concentrations were related to decreased relative risk of all-cause mortality (HR (95% CI): 0.41 (0.19, 0.90)) [29].

Association Between Plant-Based Diets and Colorectal Cancer Prognosis
We identified a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis on postdiagnostic intake of whole grains and all-cause mortality in CRC survivors [19••], indicating an inverse association (SHR (95% CI): 0.83 (0.69, 0.99); I2?=?0%; n?=?3).

In a German prospective cohort study of long-term CRC survivors, Ratjen et al. [14••] investigated adherence to plant-based dietary patterns in relation to all-cause mortality. The overall PDI was related to a decreased relative risk of all-cause mortality (HR (95% CI) per 10-point increase in PDI: 0.72 (0.57, 0.91)). Moreover, findings indicated inverse associations (but imprecisely estimated) for the hPDI (HR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.67, 1.01)) and positive associations for the uPDI (HR (95% CI): 1.19 (0.96, 1.48)) (Table ?(Table22).

The importance of a healthy plant-based diet for improving overall survival was further supported by findings of the CALGB 89803/Alliance trial. For colon cancer survivors, intake of???5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day was associated with improved overall survival. In the same study, it was shown that the quality of consumed grains might play a role in colon cancer prognosis [12•, 35].

A higher consumption of refined grains (??3 vs.?<?1 serving/day) was associated with an 88% higher relative risk of overall death (HR (95% CI): 1.88 (1.25, 2.85)). Similar findings were observed for colon cancer recurrence and disease-free survival (DFS). No clear associations were observed for intake of whole grain with colon cancer prognosis. However, replacing a daily serving of refined grains with whole grains was associated with a 13-14% lower relative risk of overall mortality, recurrence and DFS, respectively (HR (95% CI): 0.87 (0.78, 0.97), 0.86 (0.77, 0.96) and 0.87 (0.79, 0.96)) [12•].

Findings from the NHS and HPFS cohorts in CRC survivors [15•] indicated that higher intake of whole grains was associated with better survival (HR (95% CI) per 5 g/d increase for all-cause mortality: 0.88 (0.80, 0.97) and for CRC mortality 0.72 (0.59, 0.88)). In the same study [15•], each increase in total fibre intake of 5 g/d was associated with a 14% lower relative risk of overall death (HR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.79, 0.93)) and a 22% decreased relative risk of CRC-specific death (HR (95% CI): 0.78 (0.65, 0.93)). The association was particularly present for cereal fibre for all-cause mortality (HR (95% CI): 0.78 (0.68, 0.90)) and CRC-specific mortality (0.67 (0.50, 0.90)). In addition, a 5 g/d increase in total fibre intake from pre- to postdiagnosis was associated with decreased all-cause and CRC-specific mortality.

High consumption of nuts, especially tree nuts, was also associated with a reduced relative risk of overall death and cancer recurrence in 826 patients with stage III colon cancer. Compared to non-consumers, participants who consumed???2 servings of nuts per week had a HR (95% CI) of 0.43 (0.25, 0.74) for OS and of 0.58 (0.37, 0.92) for DFS. Subgroup analyses showed that the beneficial effects of nut intake were particularly attributable to tree nut intake [32]. However, postdiagnostic vegetable fat intake was not clearly associated with cancer recurrence or mortality in the CALGB 89803 trial (HR (95% CI) for DFS comparing high vs. low intake: 1.17 (0.84, 1.62)) [36].

The hypothesis that higher folate intake after CRC diagnosis might increase mortality risk after tumour resection was not supported in the NHS and the HPFS cohorts (HR (95% CI) for high vs. low total folate intake for overall mortality: 1.04 (0.60, 1.82) and for CRC-specific mortality: 0.87 (0.65, 1.16)) [34].

A biomarker study provided little evidence that postdiagnosis serum concentrations of flavonoid phytoestrogens, for which anticarcinogenic effects have been found in experimental studies, were associated with CRC prognosis [33]. Neither serum genistein (isoflavone) nor luteolin (flavone) were associated with overall mortality, CRC-specific mortality, CRC recurrence and/or disease-free survival (Table ?(Table2).2). However, the association might be different according to adjuvant chemotherapy received.

Association Between Plant-Based Diets and Urinary Tract Cancer Prognosis
We identified one study on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer prognosis that did not clearly show a protective role for postdiagnosis fruit and vegetable consumption regarding recurrence [39]. In addition, for men diagnosed with non-metastatic PC, there is some, albeit very limited, evidence that a plant-based diet after diagnosis could improve overall survival. A higher intake of vegetable fat was associated with a decreased relative risk of overall death in the in the Physicians’ Health Study (HR (95% CI) for high vs. low intake: 0.65 (0.45, 0.93)). Additionally, replacing 10% of daily calories from animal fat with vegetable fat was associated with a relative risk reduction for all-cause mortality of 44% (HR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.38, 0.80)). Higher levels of saturated fat intake were also associated with increased risk of death from all causes. No clear association was detected for PC-specific mortality (HR (95% CI) high vs. low intake of vegetable fat 0.93 (0.41, 2.14)), probably attributable to the low number of events (56 PC-specific deaths) in the cohort [37]. In the HPFS cohort, higher postdiagnostic intake of nuts (??5 servings per week vs.?<?1 serving per month) was associated with a 34% lower relative risk of overall death (HR (95% CI): 0.66 (0.52, 0.83)). The estimates for PC-specific outcomes also pointed to inverse associations but were imprecisely estimated ((HR (95% CI) for lethal PC: 0.88 (0.57, 1.35) and for fatal PC: 0.62 (0.36, 1.07)) [16].

As dietary lycopene has been inversely associated with the risk of incident PC, postdiagnostic lycopene intake was evaluated in relation to PC-specific mortality in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort [38]. No overall associations could be observed using a single dietary measurement. However, when lycopene intake was assessed at two different postdiagnosis time points, average intake was inversely associated with PC-specific mortality but only in men at advanced stages (HR (95% CI): 0.41 (0.17, 0.99)). This finding is probably due to chance, but it is also possible that the use of data from two consecutive FFQs allowed the detection of an association that would have been obscured by measurement error if only data from one questionnaire had been used [38].

Future Research Directions
Interpretation of the evidence for dietary factors as determinants of cancer prognosis is challenging because of the broad scope of this area of research and heterogeneity between studies. There is large heterogeneity regarding study populations, exposures, their assessment (especially the timing of dietary assessment), as well as differences in the outcomes under investigation. In the future, studies are needed that are specifically designed to investigate dietary factors and cancer prognosis. These should allow examining associations between diet and cancer prognosis, including changes in dietary behaviour from pre- to postdiagnosis, in well-described populations of cancer survivors.

The findings of this systematic review are based on observational studies that are susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. The presence of symptoms, disease or treatment effects, comorbidities and overall health status might influence cancer survivors’ diet, and there is a plethora of other known and potentially unknown determinants of cancer prognosis [42]. Therefore, efforts should be made to clarify these factors as comprehensively as possible so that they can be considered in future studies. Until then, it is crucial that at least the most important predictors of cancer prognosis are considered covariates, including cancer stage, grade, received treatment and comorbidities [9]. Repeated assessments of diet at multiple time points should be conducted, as this may reduce within-person variation and better represents a cancer survivors’ long-term diet [13•]. Recommendations for dietary modification after a cancer diagnosis must be supported by valid and reliable evidence. Therefore, to analyse whether postdiagnostic diet has an independent benefit on cancer prognosis, future studies need to consider dietary intake before diagnosis or dietary changes from pre- to postdiagnosis.

Regarding the role of plant-based diets in cancer prognosis, future studies should focus on the investigation of plant-based dietary patterns and of specific plant-based dietary approaches that exclude meat products or animal products per se (e.g. vegetarian or vegan diets). To explore which components of a plant-based diet are particularly important for cancer prognosis, individual food groups, foods, nutrients and bioactive compounds (e.g. fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy, fibre, isoflavones and carotenoids) need further investigation.

Conclusions
Even though the evidence for postdiagnosis plant-based diets in association with cancer prognosis is very limited and studies are very heterogeneous, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn. Study findings suggest that adhering to plant-based diets might be beneficial for overall survival of cancer survivors (Table ?(Table1).1). The findings emphasise the importance of considering the quality of a plant-based diet for cancer survival, as healthy vs. unhealthy plant-based dietary patterns show associations in the opposite direction with mortality in BC and CRC survivors [11••, 14••]. There is initial evidence that healthy/unprocessed plant-based foods, including whole grains, nuts, fruit and vegetables may be beneficial for cancer prognosis. A high nut intake was consistently related to better survival of CRC, BC, and PC (Table ?(Table3),3), and, thus, further studies are needed to confirm these results. Preferring whole grains over refined grains and a high fibre intake after diagnosis seem to improve CRC prognosis. This is consistent with strong evidence that consuming whole grains and foods containing fibre decreases the risk of incident CRC [43]. The role of soy and isoflavone intake in BC prognosis remains unclear and needs further evaluation in large prospective studies from different geographic regions evaluating the whole spectrum of soy foods. To date, there is preliminary evidence that a moderate soy/isoflavone consumption has a favourable effect on prognosis, and there is no evidence that high soy consumption is associated with adverse prognostic outcomes in BC survivors. It is important that further studies on BC survival investigate whether the associations between dietary factors and survival vary according to hormone receptor status/tumour subtype (e.g. triple negative BC), hormone therapy and menopausal status, as this may contribute to the development of targeted dietary recommendations. Promoting vegetable fat intake, particularly in substitution of animal fat, might be beneficial for overall survival after a diagnosis of PC. The potentially beneficial role of dietary lycopene intake to improve PC survival needs further investigation.

In conclusion, this systematic review shows that plant-based diets and their components might have the potential to improve cancer prognosis, especially for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer survivors. Large well-designed cohort studies, considering important clinical factors (e.g. stage, treatment) and methodological aspects (e.g. time point of dietary assessment, dietary changes) are needed to provide more robust evidence on this topic.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9750928/;"abstract purpose review although plant-based diets recommended cancer prevention , role cancer survival still uncertain . purpose systematic review summarize association postdiagnosis plant-based diets prognosis cancer survivors . recent findings indication higher intake plant-based foods associated improved prognosis cancer survivors . colorectal cancer survival , better prognosis observed high intake whole grains fibre . breast cancer survival , higher intake fruit , vegetable fibre moderate intake soy/isoflavone associated beneficial outcomes . higher vegetable fat intake related improved prognosis prostate cancer survivors . summary emerging evidence suggests benefits postdiagnosis plant-based diets prognosis cancer survivors . however , given high heterogeneity studies , research cancer survivors , considering clinical factors ( e.g . treatment , stage ) methodological aspects ( e.g . timing dietary assessment ) , needed . keywords : cancer survival , cancer prognosis , plant-based diets , whole grain , vegetable , nuts introduction due rising cancer incidence worldwide combined improved survival rates especially high-income countries result advances treatment early detection past decades , number people living cancer growing [ 1 ] . according current estimates , 50.5 million people living cancer 2020 diagnosed within last 5 years , number projected increase next years [ 2 ] . cancer diagnosis recognized `` teachable moment '' [ 3 ] frequently observed trigger lifestyle changes , including changes dietary habits , hope improving cancer prognosis overall health [ 4-6 ] . date , however , specific recommendations , cancer prevention recommendations general population applied cancer survivors , although may represent specific target group different nutritional needs metabolic functions [ 7 , 8 ] . plant-based diets integral part evidence-based recommendations primary prevention cancer non-communicable diseases ( ncds ) , promoting diet rich whole grains , vegetables , fruit , nuts legumes limited consumption red processed meat [ 9 ] . cancer survivors elevated risk premature death mainly due primary cancer , also due second primary cancers comorbidities , coronary heart disease , obesity diabetes mellitus , guidelines might even important people without history cancer [ 10 ] . recent studies investigated associations dietary factors survival prognosis various cancers , findings indicated beneficial outcomes higher intake plant-based diets components cancer survivors [ 11•• , 12• , 13• , 14•• , 15• , 16 ] . context , important consider several aspects , including timing dietary assessment ( e.g . assessment cancer diagnosis ? = ? postdiagnostic diet ) , different cancer sites ( e.g . breast , colorectal , prostate cancer ) specific prognostic outcomes , cancer-specific mortality , recurrence overall survival . provide overview topic , conducted systematic review recently published meta-analyses prospective studies investigating association postdiagnostic plant-based diets overall site-specific cancer prognosis . search strategy study selection conducted systematic search recently published literature association postdiagnosis plant-based diets foods cancer prognosis individuals cancer diagnosis pubmed january 1 , 2015 november 9 , 2021. apply restrictions filters used predefined search terms . used mesh terms title/abstract text words related plant-based dietary patterns ( i.e . vegan , vegetarian , plant-based ) , food groups foods ( i.e . fruit , vegetables , whole grains , nuts , legumes , seeds , plant oils , vegetable products , soya , olive oil , tofu ) , nutrients bioactive compounds ( i.e . plant protein , folate , carotenoids , polyphenols , isoflavones , glucosinolates , fibre ) cancer ( i.e . cancer tumour , carcinoma ) , combined prognostic outcomes ( i.e . prognosis , overall survival , all-cause mortality , cancer-specific mortality/survival , recurrence ) , related study population ( i.e . cancer survivors ) study design ( i.e . prospective cohort studies , systematic reviews , meta-analyses ) . excluded cross-sectional retrospective case-control studies well studies prediagnosis diet . screening studies conducted least two independent researchers . reference lists selected articles additionally hand-searched relevant literature . search results total , 30 studies ( seven meta-analyses 23 primary studies ) met inclusion criteria ( fig . 1 ) . five 23 recently published primary studies already considered identified meta-analyses , remaining 18 primary studies additionally identified systematic literature search ( table ?

"People who routinely eat a lot of red meat may be increasing their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Processed meats, like bacon and hot dogs, are linked to an even higher risk.

Researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 200,000 people enrolled in long-term health studies for up to 36 years and found that those who regularly consumed a lot of red meat - more than a serving per day - had a significantly higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

""When we looked at the women and men who consumed the most red meat compared to the least, we found about a 50% increase in risk,"" says study author Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results were published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

It's difficult to unravel whether the meat itself or some constituent of the meat may explain the increased risk of diabetes. Another possible explanation is that people who consume a lot of red meat may have other things in common that could drive up their risk. For instance, excess body weight is a key risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes.

It turned out that the participants in the study who consumed high amounts of red meat also had higher body mass indexes. They consumed more calories and were less physically active compared with those who consumed the least red meat. Researchers used statistical methods to adjust for confounding variables. ""We found that about half of the excess risk with red meat consumption was explained by excess body weight,"" Willett says, ""but there was still an increased risk [of developing diabetes] even after taking into account body weight,"" he says.

Willett points to several potential factors that may explain the remainder of the risk. ""There's evidence that heme iron in red meat may damage the cells in the pancreas that secrete insulin,"" he says. Other evidence suggests that too much red meat can increase insulin resistance and inflammation. And scientists at Tufts University are researching how metabolites like TMAO, linked to red meat consumption, can be inflammatory.

Research by Dr. Suzanne de la Monte of Brown University has found nitrosamines, which are compounds that form when nitrites are added to foods, may promote insulin resistance diseases, including diabetes. Nitrates and nitrites are added to meat during the curing process or as a way to preserve meat. ""Then when they're heated and eaten, [nitrates and nitrites] get converted into nitrosamines,"" de la Monte explains. This year, the European Food Safety Authority determined that the level of exposure to nitrosamines in food raises a health concern. And processed meats tend to have even higher levels of nitrosamines.

People tend to think of red meat as a risk factor for heart disease due to the concentration of saturated fat, but Willett says the type of fat that people consume may also drive up the risk of diabetes. U.S. dietary guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat to 10% or less of daily calories. Willett recommends swapping servings of red meat with plant-based proteins such as nuts and soy, which have a lot of polyunsaturated fat, as a way to protect against disease.

He warns that swapping red meat for foods that are known to drive up blood sugar, such as sugary and ultraprocessed snacks, as well as refined starches like white bread, is not a healthy strategy. ""That's not going to decrease the risk of diabetes,"" he says.

Given that, in the U.S., only about 4% of people identify as vegetarian and only 1% vegan, it's not realistic to think that people will give up red meat altogether. And Tara Shrout Allen, a physician at the University of California San Diego, talks to her patients about the benefits of reducing their consumption of red meat. ""I certainly encourage them to cut down from where they are at baseline,"" Allen says.

So how much red meat is OK to consume? U.S. dietary guidelines don't specify an amount, but a recent review of observational studies suggests it's reasonable to limit daily consumption of unprocessed red meat to 50 to 100 grams - which is no more than 3.5 ounces per day - to prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Willett's recommendation goes even further. ""A limit of about one serving per week of red meat would be reasonable for people wishing to optimize health and well-being,"" Willett says.

Given the large body of evidence that links excessive red meat consumption to increased risks of heart disease and cancer, Christopher Gardner, a food scientist at Stanford University, points out that ""recommendations to limit consumption of red meat, particularly processed red meat, have been made by many national and global health organizations.""

There has long been criticism that large epidemiological studies, such as this new study, cannot establish a cause and effect between red meat consumption and the onset of disease. But it turns out that this is the best evidence scientists have.

To prove cause and effect, scientists would need to carry out large randomized controlled trials - the type of research used in drug trials. But when it comes to food intake, Gardner says, these types of studies ""will never be conducted."" In part that's because they'd be too expensive and it can take decades for food-related diseases such as Type 2 diabetes to develop.

""Recruitment would be a herculean task,"" Gardner says, since researchers would need thousands of people to volunteer to be randomly assigned to follow a diet where they either indulged in red meat or severely restricted it for many years. ""Retention would likely be a nightmare,"" Gardner says.

So though the evidence is far from perfect, he says there's now a large body of observational evidence all pointing to increased health risks from excessive red meat consumption. He says that scaling back on red meat and processed meats can help protect both health and the environment, since livestock produce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change.";https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/19/1207123096/red-meat-type-2-diabetes-risk-processed-meat-bacon-hot-dogs;people routinely eat lot red meat may increasing risk developing type 2 diabetes , according new study . processed meats , like bacon hot dogs , linked even higher risk . researchers tracked eating habits 200,000 people enrolled long-term health studies 36 years found regularly consumed lot red meat - serving per day - significantly higher risk developing type 2 diabetes . `` looked women men consumed red meat compared least , found 50 % increase risk , '' says study author dr. walter willett harvard t.h . chan school public health . results published american journal clinical nutrition .

"""Plant-based"" foods are increasingly on the radar. You can grab a green juice at most chain coffee shops, a decent salad at airport restaurants, or a meat-free veggie burger at some locations of the major burger chains. And at many local grocery stores or farmers' markets, you can purchase ingredients to cook a veggie-based meal.

Research shows many benefits of a plant-based diet, especially for overall and heart health. For example, in looking across multiple studies, vegetarians were found to have a 9% lower risk of death overall, 29% lower risk of death from heart disease, and 18% lower risk of cancer vs. non-vegetarians. Now, two new papers authored by PCF-funded researchers report benefits of plant-based diets for prostate cancer.

A plant-based diet may reduce risk of developing or dying from prostate cancer
A team including PCF-funded investigators Dr. Stacy Loeb and Dr. Stacey Kenfield reviewed multiple studies to address this question. The studies asked participants about their diet, followed them for many years, and counted the number of prostate cancer cases and deaths from prostate cancer. There was some variation in the definition of the diet (see Sidebar); generally, vegetarians/vegans were compared to nonvegetarians. Overall, the authors reported that a plant-based diet was linked to either a decreased risk of prostate cancer or had no effect on risk.

Aligned with these findings, a study authored by Drs. Loeb and Kenfield, along with PCF-funded scientists Dr. Lorelei Mucci and Dr. June Chan followed more than 47,000 health professionals over 28 years. Investigators computed three different dietary scores for each participant: overall plant-based, healthful plant-based, and unhealthful plant-based (see Sidebar). Key results included:

Eating a more plant-based diet overall was linked to lower risk of fatal prostate cancer. Men with the highest plant-based diet score had a 19% lower risk of fatal prostate cancer vs men with the lowest diet score.
Eating a healthful plant-based diet was linked to a lower risk of being diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.
Some effects of diet differed by age. For example, among men under age 65 at diagnosis, eating a more plant-based diet was linked to a 42% lower risk of advanced prostate cancer.
Dr. Mucci presented some results of this study in a PCF webinar which can be viewed here.

How might a plant-based diet be protective against some types of prostate cancer? The authors suggest a number of possible biological effects, such as greater consumption of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that are naturally present in fruits and vegetables.

A plant-based diet may improve outcomes among patients with prostate cancer

Clinical trials of plant-based diets have focused on two groups of men with prostate cancer: those with low-risk disease on active surveillance, and those with biochemical recurrence after initial treatment. For example, the Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial randomized 93 men with low-risk prostate cancer to a one-year intensive lifestyle program including a very low-fat vegan diet, regular exercise, stress management, and a support group. Patients in the control group received usual care. After one year, patients in the intervention group had significantly lower PSA levels vs the control group. After two years, significantly fewer patients in the intervention group had gone on to have prostate cancer treatment (2) vs in the control group (13). Patients in the lifestyle intervention group also experienced other health benefits, such as reduced weight, cholesterol, and perceived stress.

Trials of a plant-based diet (coupled with stress reduction) in patients with recurrent prostate cancer showed an increase in PSA doubling time, which may suggest less aggressive cancer. These studies were small, with short follow-up time. While these findings are promising, more research is needed.

 What this means for patients: If you've been thinking about adopting a more plant-based diet-maybe swapping out some meat and dairy for more fruits, veggies, and whole grains-these studies suggest that may help lower your risk of certain types of prostate cancer, or of prostate cancer progression.

"Milk and other dairy products are the top source of saturated fat in the American diet, contributing to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have also linked dairy to an increased risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.
Saturated Fat and Heart Disease
Milk and other dairy products are the top sources of artery-clogging saturated fat in the American diet. Milk products also contain cholesterol. Diets high in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease, which remains America's top killer. Cheese is especially dangerous. Typical cheeses are 70 percent fat.

Lactose Intolerance
Infants and children produce enzymes that break down lactose, the sugar found in breast milk and cow's milk, but as we grow up, many of us lose this capacity. Lactose intolerance is common, affecting about 95 percent of Asian Americans, 74 percent of Native Americans, 70 percent of African Americans, 53 percent of Mexican Americans, and 15 percent of Caucasians. Symptoms include upset stomach, diarrhea, and gas.

Bone Health
Research shows that dairy products have little or no benefit for bone health. According to an analysis published in the British Medical Journal, most studies fail to show any link between dairy intake and broken bones, or fractures. In one study, researchers tracked the diets, exercise, and stress fracture rates of adolescent girls and concluded that dairy products and calcium do not prevent stress fractures. Another study of more than 96,000 people found that the more milk men consumed as teenagers, the more bone fractures they experienced as adults. Learn about how to build strong bones on a plant-based diet. 

Cancer
Research has linked the high fat content and hormones in milk, cheese, and other dairy products to breast cancer.

One study of nearly 10,000 women found that those who consume low-fat diets have a 23% lower risk for breast cancer recurrence. They also have a 17% lower risk of dying from the disease.

A 2017 study funded by the National Cancer Institute that compared the diets of women diagnosed with breast cancer to those without breast cancer found that those who consumed the most American, cheddar, and cream cheeses had a 53% higher risk for breast cancer.

The Life After Cancer Epidemiology study found that, among women previously diagnosed with breast cancer, those consuming one or more servings of high-fat dairy products (e.g., cheese, ice cream, whole milk) daily had a 49% higher breast cancer mortality, compared with those consuming less than one-half serving daily.

Research funded by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, and the World Cancer Research Fund, found that women who consumed 1/4 to 1/3 cup of cow's milk per day had a 30% increased chance for breast cancer. One cup per day increased the risk by 50%, and 2-3 cups were associated with an 80% increased chance of breast cancer. But the study cites research showing that vegans, but not lacto-ovo-vegetarians, experience less breast cancer than nonvegetarians. 

Regular consumption of dairy products has also been linked to prostate cancer.

High intakes of dairy products including whole and low-fat milk increase the risk for prostate cancer, according to a meta-analysis that looked at 32 studies. In another study, men who consumed three or more servings of dairy products a day had a 141% higher risk for death due to prostate cancer compared to those who consumed less than one serving. 

But avoiding dairy products and eating a more plant-based diet may help protect the prostate. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that men who followed a vegan diet had a 35% lower prostate cancer risk than those following a nonvegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, or semi-vegetarian diet. 

Health Concerns About Dairy Fact Sheet
Many Americans, including some vegetarians, still consume substantial amounts of dairy products. And government policies still promote these products, despite scientific evidence that questions their health benefits and indicates their potential health risks.

"WASHINGTON, D.C.-Naturally occurring hormones and compounds in dairy products may play a role in increasing the risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, according to a new narrative review by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine published in the International Journal for Disease Reversal and Prevention.

""Ditch the dairy to avoid the naturally occurring hormones and compounds in cow's milk that can increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers,"" says Anna Herby, DHSc, RD, CDCES, a co-author of the review and the nutrition education program manager for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. ""Calcium, protein, and other nutrients can be obtained through healthful plant sources containing antioxidants that actually reduce your cancer risk.""

Dairy products contain estrogens and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hormones that naturally occur in cow's milk. Consuming dairy products can lead to excess levels of these hormones in the body, which are linked to breast and prostate cancers. Estrogens are present in all cow's milk but are more concentrated in milk from pregnant cows (dairy cows are impregnated annually and are milked during much of their pregnancy). Humans also produce IGF-1 in response to drinking milk, leading to significantly increased concentrations in the body.

The review cites several large studies that show dairy consumption increases prostate cancer risk. In the Physicians' Health Study, which followed 21,660 men for 28 years, those consuming 2.5 servings of dairy daily had a 34% higher risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with men consuming half a serving or less. Whole milk intake was associated with risk of progression to fatal disease after diagnosis. 

Research showing the association between dairy and breast cancer is mixed, which may be in part to study limitations, although recent research shows that dairy increases breast cancer risk. The Adventist Health Study-2 followed 52,795 pre- and postmenopausal women for an average of 7.9 years and found that higher intakes of cow's milk were associated with a 50% increased risk for breast cancer. Full-fat and reduced-fat milks produced similar results.

Lactose in cow's milk may play a role in ovarian cancer risk. Studies suggest that when lactose breaks down into galactose, a sugar in lactose, it may interfere with a hormone that regulates function of the ovaries and eventually lead to ovarian cancer. Estrogen and IGF-1 may also play a role in ovarian cancer risk.

The Swedish Mammography Cohort included 61,084 women aged 38-76 years who were followed for an average 13.5 years. Women who consumed two or more glasses of milk a day had twice the risk of serous ovarian cancer, compared with women who never or seldom drank milk.

"Beans and Legumes are a much-needed weapon against cancer.

Beans and legumes, the humble staples of many global cuisines, are gaining recognition in the scientific community for their potential role in reducing the risk and mortality of many diseases and cancer. This blog post will delve into the research behind these claims, shedding light on why I put beans and legumes in my Cancer Food Pyramid Tactic.

What are Beans and Legumes?

Beans and legumes are the fruits or seeds of a family of plants called Fabaceae. They are rich sources of fiber, essential vitamins and minerals, and plant-based protein. Common examples include chickpeas, lentils, peas, kidney beans, black beans, soybeans, pinto beans, navy beans, and peanuts.[1]

Nutritional Powerhouses

Beans and legumes are high in minerals and fiber without the saturated fat found in some animal proteins. They are rich in plant protein, fiber, B-vitamins, iron, folate, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc.

One cup (164 grams) of cooked chickpeas contains 269 calories, 14.5 grams of protein, 4.25 grams of fat, 45 grams of carbohydrates, 12.5 grams of fiber. It also provides 71% of the Daily Value (DV) for folate (vitamin B9), 64% of the DV for copper, 73% of the DV for manganese, and 26% of the DV for iron.1

Similarly, one cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils contains 230 calories, 17.9 grams of protein, 0.752 gram of fat, 39.8 grams of carbs, 15.6 grams of fiber?. It also provides 30% of the DV for thiamine (vitamin B1), 90% of the DV for folate (vitamin B9), 55% of the DV for copper, and 37% of the DV for iron.1

Beans and Legumes vs Cancer

Research indicates that beans and legumes may help reduce cholesterol levels, decrease blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity by reducing IGF (insulin growth factor), increase healthy gut bacteria, and may reduce inflammation.[2] All of these are risks for cancer.

Higher beans consumption reis associated with reduced the risk of several cancers such as:

breast cancer[3]
colorectal cancer[4]
lung cancer[5]
prostate cancer[6]
ovarian cancer[7]
pancreatic cancer[8]
esophageal cancer[9]
endometrial cancer[10]
gastric cancer[11]
Dietary Fiber

Beans and legumes are high in dietary fiber which may support the growth of health-promoting gut bacteria (the microbiome)?. There is probable evidence that foods with dietary fiber decrease the risk of colorectal cancer?.

Phytochemicals

Beans and legumes contain numerous potentially protective phytochemicals called polyphenol compounds?. These natural substances may help to prevent cancer?.

Antioxidants

Beans and legumes contain antioxidants that protect the body from damage. Cancer develops when DNA in cells is damaged. This causes abnormal cells to divide uncontrollably which can infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Antioxidants neutralize these damage processes while protecting and restoring cells?.

Legume Consumption Reduces Cancer Mortality

A study from Spain's Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y la Nutrición (CIBEROBN) followed 7,216 people for an average of six years. The researchers found that those who ate more legumes had half the number of cancer deaths compared to those who ate fewer legumes?.

Canned Beans

Dried beans soaked and cooked are the best source of beans. If time is limited, you may have to consume canned beans. Check the label to make sure they are organic if possible. This will help decrease your exposure to pesticides and herbicides. Canned beans should be in a BPA free can liner. BPA is an estrogenic chemical associated with a slight risk of cancer. Rinse the beans with water prior to heating or eating. Most canned beans are precooked so you don't have to cook them.

Do not heat the beans in the can. The only reason I'm saying there are some people on social media cooking beans in cans. Doing so may transfer the estrogenic plastic liner into the beans.[12]

How Many Beans and Lentils for a Meal

Typically, a cup of beans or lentils are the correct amount for 1 meal. This fits into my recommendation of 2 palms of beans or lentils with a meal. If you are a larger guy 2 palms will be more than 1 cup, that's ok. The palm rule is a great way to adjust for body size. The 3rd palm can be a vegetable.

Conclusion

The evidence is clear: incorporating more beans and legumes into your diet can have significant health benefits. While more research is needed to fully understand their impact on individual cancers, current studies suggest a strong correlation between increased consumption of these foods and reduced cancer risk and mortality.

"Grains are one of the most important food sources worldwide. It's estimated that people began eating grains more than 75,000 years ago. Those grains — such as einkorn and emmer, the ancestors of modern wheats — were harvested as they grew wild near the banks of rivers.

Ancient people prepared and ate grains in much the same ways we do today — for example, making flours for bread-type foods and steaming rice. Today, grain foods continue to be versatile ingredients in cereals, breads, pastas, snacks, salads, stews and much more.

September is National Whole Grains Month, so let's take a look at some frequently asked questions regarding whole grains.

What is a whole grain?
Whole-grain kernels have three major parts: the bran, the germ and the endosperm. The bran and germ — which contain fiber, vitamins and minerals — are removed when grains are refined, leaving just the starchy endosperm for refined ""white"" flour and products. When grain products are labeled ""enriched,"" that means that manufacturers have put back some of the nutrients that were removed in the refining process. However, not all the nutrients are put back, and even when they are, often they are not returned in the same amounts or proportions as when they were in the original grain.

Why should we eat whole grains?
Evidence shows that eating a diet rich in plant foods — including whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans — can help reduce cancer risk. According to the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), there is strong evidence that eating at least three servings of whole-grain foods per day decreases the risk of colorectal cancer. Consuming whole grains also has been shown to promote cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Fiber — found in whole grains as well as other plant-based foods — also reduces colorectal cancer risk. The AICR recommends eating at least 30 grams of fiber per day. Most Americans do not meet the recommendations for daily whole grain or fiber intake.

What is a serving of whole grain?
One ounce of whole grains equals a serving. This is equivalent to about ? cup of cooked grains, such as pasta, rice or oatmeal, or usually one slice of bread.

Do whole grains or gluten cause inflammation?
Many studies show that whole grains can actually reduce inflammation in the body. People with celiac disease or gluten intolerance should avoid gluten, but there is no evidence that gluten is inflammatory for individuals who do not have an intolerance. The good news is, if you do have to avoid gluten, there are plenty of gluten-free whole grains, including rice, quinoa, corn, buckwheat (which, despite its name, does not belong to the wheat family), amaranth, millet, sorghum and some oats.

Many diets claim we need to avoid or limit wheat, grains or carbohydrates. Should we cut back on carbs for better health or to manage weight?
Eating too much of anything can contribute to weight gain. It's a good idea to be mindful of whole-grain products that contain a lot of added sugar or saturated fat (extra calories), and keep portion size in mind. However, wheat and grains do not specifically contribute to weight gain. In fact, we know that many people around the world live on grain-based diets and eat more wheat than Americans, but have much lower rates of obesity. The fiber in whole grains can also help you feel fuller throughout the day.

Grains are a source of carbohydrate, which does turn into sugar as it is digested and can be stored as fat. Some diets, such as the ketogenic diet, promote a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates so that your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. However, if your overall calorie intake remains the same, your body will not use your stored fat for energy any more or any less on this type of diet than if your diet was high in carbohydrates.

What about phytate, or ""antinutrients""?
Phytate (phytic acid) is a compound found in grains and beans. It was once suggested that this compound was an ""antinutrient,"" because it can bind to minerals such as zinc and iron, or prevent calcium absorption, stopping your body from utilizing these nutrients and increasing the risk of osteoporosis.

However, according to research, this effect appears to happen only when very large amounts of phytates are consumed along with a nutrient-poor diet. In addition, cooking or soaking the grains disables the mineral-binding ability of phytic acid. Consuming whole grains has not been shown to have any adverse effect on nutrient status. Phytic acid may even be beneficial for health, with potential roles in protecting against cancer and other diseases.

Do all of the grains we eat have to be whole grains?
No. While at least three servings of whole grains per day is the optimal goal, research suggests that increasing your current whole-grain consumption by one serving can lead to positive health benefits.

To celebrate National Whole Grains Month, start small with some of these steps:

Keep learning. Learn about different types of whole grains, how to spot a whole grain, new recipes and more with information from the Whole Grains Council.
Make simple swaps. Make a sandwich or wrap with whole-grain bread or whole-grain tortilla; choose whole-grain pasta or brown rice for dinner one night; find a whole-grain cereal you like for breakfast; or swap out some snacks for whole-grain options, such as popcorn or whole-grain crackers.
Find flavor. Look for creative ways to try new grains and add whole grains to your day with recipes like these:
Try Aztec Amaranth Cocoa Porridge for breakfast.
Make a pot of Tex Mex Sorghum Chili and have it for lunch during the week.

"In the race to find answers about ovarian cancer, researchers now have something to cluck about. For five years, University of Illinois researchers have been using the chicken as a model to study this deadly disease and have recently discovered that a diet enriched with flaxseed decreases severity of ovarian cancer and increases survival in hens.

Flaxseed is the richest plant source of alpha-linolenic acid, one type of omega-3 fatty acid. Several studies have already shown that flaxseed inhibits the formation of colon, breast, skin and lung tumors.

For these reasons, it was logical to study how omega-3 fatty acids affect ovarian cancer as there continues to be no effective treatment at this time, said Janice Bahr, a professor emerita in the U of I Department of Animal Sciences and one of the nation's leading poultry researchers.

According to Bahr, 25,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and 15,000 die. The incidences of death in other cancers have dropped recently, but ovarian cancer death rates have remained the same.

""The chicken is the only animal that spontaneously develops ovarian cancer on the surface of the ovaries like humans,"" Bahr said. ""In this study, we evaluated how a flaxseed-enriched diet affected 2-year-old laying hens (hens that have ovulated as many times as a woman entering menopause).""

The results showed that hens fed a flaxseed-enriched diet for one year experienced a significant reduction in late-stage ovarian tumors.

""Most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have a very poor prognosis because they are not diagnosed until stage 3 or 4 when the cancer has metastasized and spread to other parts of the body,"" Bahr said.

Hens fed the control diet had significantly more late-stage tumors that presented with fluid and metastases as compared to the hens fed a flaxseed diet. Though hens fed the flaxseed diet did not have a decreased incidence of ovarian cancer, they did experience fewer late-stage tumors and higher survival rates.

""In hens fed flaxseed, we found that more tumors were confined to the ovary and they had less metastatic spread,"" she said. ""This is an important finding as the metastases that accompany late-stage ovarian cancer are the main cause of death from this disease. If the cancer is found at an early stage, when the tumor is still confined to the ovary, women have a much better prognosis and more treatment options.""

In addition, researchers found that hens fed the flaxseed diet had better weight control which is important because obesity increases cancer risk. Both diets had equal caloric content, however the flaxseed-fed hens weighed less at six months than the control-fed hens. But at 12 months, the flaxseed-fed hens were the same weight and the control-fed hens had loss significant weight, which was indicative of their failing health. Ultimately, the flaxseed-enriched diet helped the birds maintain a healthy weight and resulted in less sickness and death.

""Through this research, we have proven that flaxseed supplementation for one year is able to reduce the severity of ovarian cancer in hens,"" she said. ""These findings may provide the basis for a clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy of flaxseed as a chemosuppressant of ovarian cancer in women.""

The cause of ovarian cancer remains unknown, but one of the most prevalent theories is the ""incessant ovulation hypothesis,"" proposed by MF Fathalla in 1971. He suggests that inflammation associated with continuous ovulation leaves ovarian surface epithelial cells susceptible to malignant transformation. The observation that egg-laying domestic hens frequently develop ovarian cancer supports this hypothesis.

Bahr believes this hypothesis is valid and is currently in the middle of a four-year study to determine if long-term dietary intervention with flaxseed will reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer development. The hens started the flaxseed-supplemented diet at 22 weeks of age, as soon as they commenced egg laying and before damage from ovulation had accumulated.

This research was published in Gynecologic Oncology and funded by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Grant, an American Institute for Cancer Research Grant, and an NIH Training Grant.

Researchers included principal investigator Dale Buchanan Hales of Southern Illinois University. Co-principal investigators include Janice Bahr of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Kristine Ansenberger and Cassandra Richards of the University of Illinois at Chicago; and Yan Zhuge, Judith Luborsky and Animesh Barua of Rush University Medical Center.

"Patients who consume high-fat dairy products following breast cancer diagnosis increase their chances of dying from the disease years later, according to a study by Kaiser Permanente researchers.

The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is the first to examine the relationship between high-fat and low-fat dairy consumption following a diagnosis of breast cancer and long-term breast cancer survival.

Previous studies have shown that higher lifetime exposure to estrogen is a causal pathway to breast cancer. Estrogen levels are believed to be elevated in dairy products consumed in the Western world, because most of its milk comes from pregnant cows. Estrogenic hormones reside primarily in fat, so levels are higher in high-fat than in low-fat dairy products.

The researchers studied a cohort of women who were diagnosed with early-stage, invasive breast cancer between 1997 and 2000, primarily from Kaiser Permanente's Northern California region (83 percent) and the Utah Cancer Registry (12 percent).

Those consuming larger amounts of high-fat dairy (one serving or more per day) had ""higher breast cancer mortality as well as higher all-cause mortality and higher non-breast cancer mortality,"" wrote lead author Candyce H. Kroenke, ScD, MPH, staff scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, and co-authors.

""Specifically, women consuming one or more servings per day of high-fat dairy had a 64 percent higher risk of dying from any cause and a 49 percent increased risk of dying from their breast cancer during the follow-up period,"" said Kroenke. The category of high-fat dairy products researchers tracked included cream, whole milk, condensed or evaporated milk, pudding, ice cream, custard, flan and also cheeses and yogurts that were not low-fat or non-fat.

In general, the women studied reported that they consumed low-fat milk and butter most often, and they consumed relatively limited amounts of low-fat dairy desserts, low-fat cheese and high-fat yogurt. Overall, low-fat dairy intake was greater (median 0.8 servings per day) than high-fat dairy (median 0.5 servings per day).

The study found an association between high-fat dairy and breast cancer mortality, but no association with low-fat dairy products and breast cancer outcomes.

""High-fat dairy is generally not recommended as part of a healthy diet,"" said senior author Bette J. Caan, DrPH, research scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research. ""Switching to low-fat dairy is an easy thing to modify.""

Women entered into the cohort approximately two years after their breast cancer diagnosis. At the beginning of the study, 1,893 women completed a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire, and 1,513 of these women completed a follow-up questionnaire six years later. They were followed for 12 years on average following study entry.

The women were asked how often they consumed dairy foods during the previous year; what portion sizes they generally consumed; which products they ate, including milk, cheese, dairy desserts, yogurt and beverages made with milk (such as hot chocolate or lattes); and whether the dairy products were full fat, low fat or nonfat.

Of the total sample, 349 women had a recurrence of breast cancer and 372 died of any cause, 189 (50.8 percent) of them from breast cancer.

This research was part of the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) study, one of several efforts by investigators with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research to consider the role of lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise and social support on long-term breast cancer survival and recurrence. While hundreds of studies have examined the role of lifestyle factors in cancer risk and prevention, this study is one of a small but growing number that focus on the role of lifestyle factors after a breast cancer diagnosis.

For example, the Pathways study of breast cancer survivorship, based at the Division of Research, is collecting and analyzing data about women's genetic background, tumor characteristics and lifestyle choices immediately after diagnosis. Findings from this study, along with the LACE study, are providing objective information to help guide women as they make decisions following a breast cancer diagnosis; among these findings are that soy decreases the risk of breast cancer recurrence, quality of life after diagnosis influences outcomes, and physical activity is beneficial.

Susan E. Kutner, MD, chair of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Regional Breast Care Task Force, said that the new study bolsters the counseling that Kaiser Permanente gives breast cancer survivors about the importance of a low-fat diet, as well as exercise and weight management, in preventing recurrence of the disease. ""Women have been clamoring for this type of information,"" Dr. Kutner said. ""They're asking us, 'Tell me what I should eat?' With this information, we can be more specific about recommending low-fat dairy products.""

"People who eat nuts, particularly walnuts, are more likely to live longer, finds research in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine. In a longitudinal study, researchers suggest that those who eat nuts more than three times a week have a reduced risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease than non-nut eaters.

The PREDIMED nutrition trial based in Spain looked at the effect on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease of over 7000 older people (aged 55 to 90) randomized to a Mediterranean Diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts, compared to a control group following a low fat diet.

In Mediterranean regions, nut consumption is relatively high compared to other countries.

People who ate nuts tended to have a lower BMI and smaller waist.

They were also less likely to smoke and were more physically active than those who rarely or never ate nuts.

Nut eating was associated with a better diet in general as these people ate more vegetables, fruit and fish.

There were fewer people with type 2 diabetes or people taking medicine for hypertension in the group of people who ate the most nuts.

Overall, nut eaters had a 39% lower mortality risk and walnut eaters 45% lower -- meaning that they were less likely to die than the non-nut eaters.

People eating more than 3 servings (1 serving -- 28 g) a week of nuts reduced risk of death due to cardiovascular disease by 55% and cancer by 40%. A similar effect was demonstrated for walnuts.

Prof Jordi Salas-Salvadó, from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili who led this study explained, ""Quite how nuts are able prevent premature mortality is not entirely clear, nor why walnut should be better for you than other nuts. Walnuts have particularly high content of alpha-linoleic acid and phytochemicals, especially in their 'skin' both of which, along with fibre and minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, may contribute to their healthy effect.""";https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130715202458.htm;people eat nuts , particularly walnuts , likely live longer , finds research biomed central 's open access journal bmc medicine . longitudinal study , researchers suggest eat nuts three times week reduced risk dying cancer cardiovascular disease non-nut eaters . predimed nutrition trial based spain looked effect primary prevention cardiovascular disease 7000 older people ( aged 55 90 ) randomized mediterranean diet supplemented extra virgin olive oil nuts , compared control group following low fat diet . mediterranean regions , nut consumption relatively high compared countries . people ate nuts tended lower bmi smaller waist . also less likely smoke physically active rarely never ate nuts . nut eating associated better diet general people ate vegetables , fruit fish . fewer people type 2 diabetes people taking medicine hypertension group people ate nuts . overall , nut eaters 39 % lower mortality risk walnut eaters 45 % lower -- meaning less likely die non-nut eaters . people eating 3 servings ( 1 serving -- 28 g ) week nuts reduced risk death due cardiovascular disease 55 % cancer 40 % . similar effect demonstrated walnuts . prof jordi salas-salvadó , universitat rovira virgili led study explained , `` quite nuts able prevent premature mortality entirely clear , walnut better nuts . walnuts particularly high content alpha-linoleic acid phytochemicals , especially 'skin ' , along fibre minerals calcium , magnesium potassium , may contribute healthy effect .

"Cancer and type 2 diabetes are two of the most significant public health burdens facing the world today, and currently available data suggests their prevalence is expected to continue to increase. Nut consumption has long been hypothesized to have a role in preventing both of these diseases, but until now evidence has been inconsistent. A new systematic review and meta-analysis published in Nutrition Reviews on June 16 shows that nut consumption is, indeed, associated with a decreased risk of certain types of cancer, but not type 2 diabetes.

Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 observational studies (which included 30,708 patients) on the disease-preventive powers of nut consumption to create a comprehensive analysis.

Upon completion, the authors concluded: ""nut consumption was inversely associated with risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer, but not with other types of cancer or type 2 diabetes. Overall, nut intake was associated with a decreased risk of cancer.""

While many studies have evaluated the disease-preventive powers of nuts, the authors emphasize there is still a scarcity of available data on the relationship between individual types of cancer and nut consumption.

Additional studies are consequently needed to more accurately assess these relationships.

""This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis study estimating the association between nut intake and risk of cancers. Our study suggests that nut consumption may be associated with reduced risk of cancers, which may have practical implication. Aligning with the known beneficial effect of nuts on heart diseases, our study may imply that individuals interested in making better food choices to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease can consider consuming nuts, after considering the caloric and fat contents of different types of nuts,"" said Lang Wu, the lead author of this study.";https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150616114247.htm;cancer type 2 diabetes two significant public health burdens facing world today , currently available data suggests prevalence expected continue increase . nut consumption long hypothesized role preventing diseases , evidence inconsistent . new systematic review meta-analysis published nutrition reviews june 16 shows nut consumption , indeed , associated decreased risk certain types cancer , type 2 diabetes . researchers mayo clinic rochester , minnesota , university minnesota minneapolis , minnesota conducted systematic review meta-analysis 36 observational studies ( included 30,708 patients ) disease-preventive powers nut consumption create comprehensive analysis . upon completion , authors concluded : `` nut consumption inversely associated risk colorectal cancer , endometrial cancer , pancreatic cancer , types cancer type 2 diabetes . overall , nut intake associated decreased risk cancer .

"Eating a diet higher in saturated fat, a type of fat found commonly in foods such as fatty beef and cheese, was linked to more aggressive prostate cancer, a study by University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers and collaborators has found. The preliminary results were presented Monday, April 18 at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in New Orleans.

""We show that high dietary saturated fat content is associated with increased prostate cancer aggressiveness,"" said Emma H. Allott, PhD, a research assistant professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.

""This may suggest that limiting dietary saturated fat content, which we know is important for overall health and cardiovascular disease prevention, may also have a role in prostate cancer.""

The results were drawn from a survey of 1,854 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009 in North Carolina and in Louisiana as part of a larger study called the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.

Men were asked a series of questions about their diet and other factors at the time of diagnosis with prostate cancer, and then researchers examined the association between saturated fat intake and the aggressiveness of the men's tumor at diagnosis.

They adjusted dietary saturated fat for total fat intake in their statistical models in order to tease apart the effects of saturated fat from total fat intake.

They gauged aggressiveness using the results of the patients' prostate cancer-specific antigen, or PSA, tests, as well as the clinical stage of their cancer and Gleason grade.

They found that higher saturated fat intake was linked to increased prostate cancer aggressiveness.

Allott said that high saturated fat content in the diet contributes to raised blood cholesterol levels, and the researchers also found in the study that men taking statins, which are drugs used to control cholesterol levels, had weaker associations between saturated fat intake and prostate cancer aggressiveness.

These findings may suggest that statins counteract, but do not completely reverse, the effects of high saturated fat intake on prostate cancer aggressiveness.

In addition, they found that higher levels of polyunsaturated fats, which are found in foods such as fish and nuts, were linked to lower levels of prostate cancer aggressiveness.

Allott said future research goals include investigating the mechanisms behind the associations.";https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160419081941.htm;eating diet higher saturated fat , type fat found commonly foods fatty beef cheese , linked aggressive prostate cancer , study university north carolina lineberger comprehensive cancer center researchers collaborators found . preliminary results presented monday , april 18 american association cancer research annual meeting new orleans . `` show high dietary saturated fat content associated increased prostate cancer aggressiveness , '' said emma h. allott , phd , research assistant professor unc gillings school global public health . `` may suggest limiting dietary saturated fat content , know important overall health cardiovascular disease prevention , may also role prostate cancer .

"While a plant-based diet is generally considered healthier than a meat-based diet in preventing the risk of diabetes, not all meats affect the risk equally. As Professor Koh Woon Puay, Professor of Clinical Sciences at Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), and her team found out, higher intake of red meat and poultry is associated with significantly increased risk of developing diabetes, which is partially attributed to their higher content of heme iron in these meats. This study provides the basis for evidence-based dietary recommendations to the Singapore population in mitigating diabetes risk and reducing the healthcare burden of this chronic condition.

These findings come from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which recruited 63,257 adults aged 45-74 years between 1993 and 1998, and then followed them up for an average of about 11 years.

The study found a positive association between intakes of red meat and poultry, and risk of developing diabetes.

Specifically, compared to those in the lowest quartile intake, those in the highest quartile intake of red meat and poultry had a 23 per cent and 15 per cent increase in risk of diabetes, respectively, while the intake of fish/shellfish was not associated with risk of diabetes.

The increase in risk associated with red meat/poultry was reduced by substituting them with fish/shellfish.

In trying to understand the underlying mechanism for the role of red meat and poultry in the development of diabetes, the study also investigated the association between dietary heme-iron content from all meats and the risk of diabetes, and found a dose-dependent positive association.

After adjusting for heme-iron content in the diet, the red-meat and diabetes association was still present, suggesting that other chemicals present in red meat could be accountable for the increase in risk of diabetes.

Conversely, the association between poultry intake and diabetes risk became null, suggesting that this risk was attributable to the heme-iron content in poultry.

This is one of the largest Asian studies looking at meat consumption and diabetes risk.

While the findings are consistent with other Western studies that have shown that the increased intake of red meat and increase in heme-iron content of diet could increase the risk of diabetes, this study demonstrated the additional risk of red meat attributable to other possible chemicals, other than its heme-iron content.

It also suggested that chicken parts with lower heme-iron contents such as breast meat, compared to thighs, could be healthier.

Finally, the study also demonstrated the benefit of replacing red meat or poultry with fish/shellfish.

Describing the key take home message for the public, senior author of the study Professor Koh said, ""We don't need to remove meat from the diet entirely. Singaporeans just need to reduce the daily intake, especially for red meat, and choose chicken breast and fish/shellfish, or plant-based protein food and dairy products, to reduce the risk of diabetes. At the end of the day, we want to provide the public with information to make evidence-based choices in picking the healthier food to reduce disease risk.""

""Although a number of western studies have consistently shown that red meat consumption should be moderated, this study is highly relevant as it is based on local population and consumption patterns. The findings affirm HPB's recommendation to consume red meat in moderation, and that a healthy and balanced diet should contain sufficient and varied protein sources, including healthier alternatives to red meat such as fish, tofu and legumes,"" said Dr Annie Ling, Director, Policy, Research and Surveillance Division, Health Promotion Board.

"Consuming more than 7 grams (>1/2 tablespoon) of olive oil per day is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, neurodegenerative disease mortality and respiratory disease mortality, according to a study publishing today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study found that replacing about 10 grams/day of margarine, butter, mayonnaise and dairy fat with the equivalent amount of olive oil is associated with lower risk of mortality as well.

""Our findings support current dietary recommendations to increase the intake of olive oil and other unsaturated vegetable oils,"" said Marta Guasch-Ferré, PhD, a senior research scientist at the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the study's lead author. ""Clinicians should be counseling patients to replace certain fats, such as margarine and butter, with olive oil to improve their health. Our study helps make more specific recommendations that will be easier for patients to understand and hopefully implement into their diets.""

Using participants from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, researchers analyzed 60,582 women and 31,801 men who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the study baseline in 1990. During 28 years of follow-up, diet was assessed by a questionnaire every four years. The questionnaire asked how often, on average, they consumed specific foods, types of fats and oils, as well as which brand or type of oils they used for cooking and added at the table in the previous year.

Olive oil consumption was calculated from the sum of three items in the questionnaire: olive oil used for salad dressings, olive oil added to food or bread, and olive oil used for baking and frying at home. One tablespoon was equivalent to 13.5 grams of olive oil. The consumption of other vegetable oils was calculated based on the participants reported oil brand and type of fat used for cooking at home. Margarine and butter consumption was based on the reported frequency of stick, tub or soft margarine consumption, and the amount of margarine or butter added from baking and frying at home. Intakes of dairy and other fats and nutrients were also calculated. The researchers found olive oil consumption increased from 1.6 grams/day in 1990 to about 4 grams/day in 2010, while margarine consumption decreased from about 12 grams/day in 1990 to about 4 grams/day in 2010. The intake of other fats remained stable.

Olive oil consumption was categorized as follows:

Never or <1 time per month
>0 to ?4.5 grams/day (>0 to ?1 teaspoon)
>4.5 to ?7 grams/day (>1 teaspoon to ?1/2 tablespoon)
>7 grams/day (>1/2 tablespoon)
Over the course of 28 years, there were 36,856 deaths with 22,768 occurring in the Nurses' Health Study and 14,076 in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants with higher olive oil consumption were often more physically active, had Southern European or Mediterranean ancestry, were less likely to smoke and had a greater consumption of fruits and vegetables compared to those with lower olive oil consumption. The average consumption of total olive oil in the highest category was about 9 grams/day at baseline and included 5% of the study participants.

When researchers compared those who rarely or never consumed olive oil, those in the highest consumption category had 19% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, 17% lower risk of cancer mortality, 29% lower risk of neurodegenerative mortality and 18% lower risk of respiratory mortality. The study also found substituting 10 grams/day of other fats, such as margarine, butter, mayonnaise and dairy fat, with olive oil was associated with 8-34% lower risk of total and cause-specific mortality. They found no significant associations when substituting olive oil for other vegetable oils.

""It's possible that higher olive oil consumption is a marker of an overall healthier diet and higher socioeconomic status. However, even after adjusting for these and other social economic status factors, our results remained largely the same,"" Guasch-Ferré said. ""Our study cohort was predominantly a non-Hispanic white population of health professionals, which should minimize potentially confounding socioeconomic factors, but may limit generalizability as this population may be more likely to lead a healthy lifestyle.""

In an accompanying editorial, Susanna C. Larsson, PhD, associate professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, said, ""The current study and previous studies have found that consumption of olive oil may have health benefits. However, several questions remain. Are the associations causal or spurious? Is olive oil consumption protective for certain cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and atrial fibrillation, only or also for other major diseases and causes of death? What is the amount of olive oil required for a protective effect? More research is needed to address these questions.""

"Trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), a long-chain fatty acid found in meat and dairy products from grazing animals such as cows and sheep, improves the ability of CD8+ T cells to infiltrate tumors and kill cancer cells, according to a new study by researchers from the University of Chicago.

The research, published this week in Nature, also shows that patients with higher levels of TVA circulating in the blood responded better to immunotherapy, suggesting that it could have potential as a nutritional supplement to complement clinical treatments for cancer.

""There are many studies trying to decipher the link between diet and human health, and it's very difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms because of the wide variety of foods people eat. But if we focus on just the nutrients and metabolites derived from food, we begin to see how they influence physiology and pathology,"" said Jing Chen, PhD, the Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine at UChicago and one of the senior authors of the new study. ""By focusing on nutrients that can activate T cell responses, we found one that actually enhances anti-tumor immunity by activating an important immune pathway.""

Finding nutrients that activate immune cells

Chen's lab focuses on understanding how metabolites, nutrients and other molecules circulating in the blood influence the development of cancer and response to cancer treatments. For the new study, two postdoctoral fellows, Hao Fan, PhD and Siyuan Xia, PhD, both co-first authors, started with a database of around 700 known metabolites that come from food and assembled a ""blood nutrient"" compound library consisting of 235 bioactive molecules derived from nutrients. They screened the compounds in this new library for their ability to influence anti-tumor immunity by activating CD8+ T cells, a group of immune cells critical for killing cancerous or virally infected cells.

After the scientists evaluated the top six candidates in both human and mouse cells, they saw that TVA performed the best. TVA is the most abundant trans fatty acid present in human milk, but the body cannot produce it on its own. Only about 20% of TVA is broken down into other byproducts, leaving 80% circulating in the blood. ""That means there must be something else it does, so we started working on it more,"" Chen said.

The researchers then conducted a series of experiments with cells and mouse models of diverse tumor types. Feeding mice a diet enriched with TVA significantly reduced the tumor growth potential of melanoma and colon cancer cells compared to mice fed a control diet. The TVA diet also enhanced the ability of CD8+ T cells to infiltrate tumors.

The team also performed a series of molecular and genetic analyses to understand how TVA was affecting the T cells. These included a new technique for monitoring transcription of single-stranded DNA called kethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing, or KAS-seq, developed by Chuan He, PhD, the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry at UChicago and another senior author of the study. These additional assays, done by both the Chen and He labs, showed that TVA inactivates a receptor on the cell surface called GPR43 which is usually activated by short-chain fatty acids often produced by gut microbiota. TVA overpowers these short-chain fatty acids and activates a cellular signaling process known as the CREB pathway, which is involved in a variety of functions including cellular growth, survival, and differentiation. The team also showed that mouse models where the GPR43 receptor was exclusively removed from CD8+ T cells also lacked their improved tumor fighting ability.

Finally, the team also worked with Justin Kline, MD, Professor of Medicine at UChicago, to analyze blood samples taken from patients undergoing CAR-T cell immunotherapy treatment for lymphoma. They saw that patients with higher levels of TVA tended to respond to treatment better than those with lower levels. They also tested cell lines from leukemia by working with Wendy Stock, MD, the Anjuli Seth Nayak Professor of Medicine, and saw that TVA enhanced the ability of an immunotherapy drug to kill leukemia cells.

Focus on the nutrients, not the food

The study suggests that TVA could be used as a dietary supplement to help various T cell-based cancer treatments, although Chen points out that it is important to determine the optimized amount of the nutrient itself, not the food source. There is a growing body of evidence about the detrimental health effects of consuming too much red meat and dairy, so this study shouldn't be taken as an excuse to eat more cheeseburgers and pizza; rather, it indicates that nutrient supplements such as TVA could be used to promote T cell activity. Chen thinks there may be other nutrients that can do the same.

""There is early data showing that other fatty acids from plants signal through a similar receptor, so we believe there is a high possibility that nutrients from plants can do the same thing by activating the CREB pathway as well,"" he said.

The new research also highlights the promise of this ""metabolomic"" approach to understanding how the building blocks of diet affect our health. Chen said his team hopes to build a comprehensive library of nutrients circulating in the blood to understand their impact on immunity and other biological processes like aging.

"Soy compounds called isoflavones are among the plant-derived compounds that may significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence or death, according to a new meta-analysis co-directed by investigators from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. The results were published Jan. 10 in the journal JNCI Cancer Spectrum.

Investigators in Australia, Denmark, England, Norway and the U.S. reviewed 22 published observational studies that examined the impact of dietary intake of soybeans, lignans (compounds found in a variety of plants including seeds and nuts), cruciferous/cabbage-family vegetables, and green tea -- and these substances' phytonutrients (natural compounds derived from plants) -- on breast cancer recurrence and mortality, as well as on mortality from all causes. This included 11 studies of soy isoflavones, three of cruciferous vegetables, two of green tea, three of lignans, and three of enterolactone, which is formed in the gut when lignans are digested.

Soy isoflavones were associated with a 26% reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence, according to a meta-analysis that included six of the studies (of 11,837 women) reviewed by investigators. The results were most notable among post-menopausal survivors. The greatest risk reduction was seen at 60 milligrams per day. This is equivalent to two to three servings per day, where one serving equates to a cup of soy milk, three ounces of tofu or a half-cup of cooked soybeans. However, the effect of soy consumption on risk of mortality was smaller (12%) and not statistically significant, and was seen mostly at 20-40 mg per day, or one to two servings.

Another finding, reported for the first time in a meta-analysis, relates to enterolactone, a compound metabolized from lignans. Lignans are found in a wide variety of plants, such as seeds, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruit and vegetables. High levels are found in flaxseeds, cashew nuts, broccoli and brussels sprouts, among other sources. Enterolactone was found to reduce the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality by 28% and death from any cause by 31%, particularly in post-menopausal women (35% reduction in death from any cause). It is not possible to calculate the effective dose of lignans in the diet from these enterolactone findings, because the gut microbiome that plays a role in metabolism of lignans varies among individuals.

""These findings were graded probable, which means there is strong research showing that they contributed to the results we are seeing,"" says lead study author Diana van Die, Ph.D., of NICM Health Research Institute at Western Sydney University, Australia.

The review also found some suggestive results, which means the results are generally consistent but rarely strong enough to justify recommendations:

Consumption of green tea suggests an effect of reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 44% in women with stage I or II breast cancer. The greatest effect was seen from consuming three to five cups per day and from five or more cups per day, as documented in two Japanese studies .
Among those who consumed lignans prior to breast cancer diagnosis, there was a non-significant 34% risk reduction in cancer-specific mortality and 19% reduction in all causes of death in post-menopausal women. However, consumption of lignans by pre-menopausal women suggests an increased risk of mortality. This result indicates that the effects of lignans are dependent on the hormonal environment, although it was likely driven by one large study and needs further investigation. The highest intake was nine or more servings per day in the studies reviewed.
The impact of cruciferous vegetables was inconclusive, possibly influenced by the average intake being quite low (less than a half-cup per day) in the studies reviewed.

Investigators also looked into whether consuming soy, lignans, cruciferous vegetables and green tea, or their phytonutrients in the diet before or after breast cancer diagnosis made a difference. However, the data did not provide a concrete answer. All studies on green tea and lignans measured pre-diagnosis intake, while soy results came from studies that measured intake before and after diagnosis.

""It is critically important to stress that these studies were conducted on women who received medical and/or surgical treatment for breast cancer, and that these foods and phytonutrients should not be considered as alternatives to treatment,"" says senior study author Channing Paller, M.D., director of prostate cancer clinical research and an associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins.

""This research highlights the need for more robust studies in this area looking at the most effective dosages of these compounds, and whether starting to consume them after diagnosis has the same effect as a lifelong dietary habit before diagnosis. This is what patients are looking for,"" Paller added .

"Research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, reports that plant based diets may be beneficial in the prevention of diabetes.

 

Prof Alexandra Johnstone, Senior Research Fellow at Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen, said:

""This is a high-impact study which has been conducted using standard epidemiological approaches to look at links between diet and health. The study looked at a large cohort (309,099 participants) to assess the link between plant-based diet and development of type 2 diabetes. It is noted that the studies all applied a self-report FFQ methodology (mentioned in the limitations) which is known to introduce bias; it is a questionnaire used to obtain frequency and, in some cases, portion size information about food and beverage consumption over a specified period of time, typically the past month or year.

""The authors control for age and BMI, but there are other lifestyle factors known to influence risk of developing diabetes (eg. family history; physical activity; ethnicity) which are not controlled for. The paper did not examine meat consumption, only plant-based diet studies were included, so it should not be confused with statements relating/comparing/contrasting to other diets (such as meat diets). There are 4 main studies that contribute to the main effect (out of the reported 9).

""The paper does support what has been reported before, that diets with high fibre content are associated with reduced risk of cardio-vascular and metabolic diseases. Future research needs to focus on what components of a plant-based diet are linked to preventative health effects. The research fits with current US and USA guidelines to consume more dietary fibre from plant sources to protect from some types of diseases. Interestingly, the paper also comments on the role of fibre on weight gain, for which there is poorer evidence. However, the people who consumed the diets in the selected studies may also apply other lifestyle approaches, such as more exercise, that contribute towards protective effects.

""Also, a dose response is not clearly identified in the paper in a way to translate to the question on how much to eat - how much fibre/plants should be consumed for a protective effect? They apply a 'healthful plant-based dietary index' and apply stats that I am not familiar with (cubic spline), so difficult to translate to real world.""

 

Prof Tom Sanders, Professor emeritus of Nutrition and Dietetics, King's College London (KCL), said:

""The conclusion that the risk of type 2 diabetes is lower in vegetarians is based on a meta-analysis of observational studies mainly from the USA with a couple from East Asia. Generally, vegetarians are lighter than meat-eaters and they eat more wholegrains - both factors that would decrease risk of developing diabetes. Some of the studies included religious groups (e.g. Seventh Day Adventists) who had different life-styles from the general population that may also affect risk of diabetes. The UK Oxford EPIC study found that those who rarely consumed meat had a lower risk of developing diabetes, but this effect disappeared when adjustments were made for body mass index (1).

""Paradoxically, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is high in South Asian vegetarians in the UK who follow their diet for religious reasons. It is uncertain why type 2 diabetes is so prevalent in South Asians and it may have its origins in early development. Indeed, a vegetarian or other plant-based diets that are high in free sugars and refined carbohydrates is likely to increase risk of type 2 diabetes especially when associated with low levels of physical activity. Consequently, the avoidance of meat does not necessarily reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.""

Dr Ian Johnson, Nutrition researcher and Emeritus Fellow, Quadram Institute Bioscience, said:

""It is well established from population studies that vegetarians tend to have a lower body-mass index and a lower risk of heart disease and other chronic health problems than meat-eaters. However, the term ""vegetarian"" is applied to a whole range of different dietary habits ranging from those who only avoid red meat to vegans who avoid all foods of animal origin.

""This rigorous statistical analysis of nine previously published prospective studies shows that the more closely the participants approached an entirely plant-based dietary pattern, the lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This was particularly true for diets containing large quantities of whole-grain cereals, nuts, fruits and vegetables, rather than foods based on highly refined flour and sugar. The benefits may come from reduced consumption of meat and other animal products, from protective effects of plant constituents such as dietary fibre, from a lower risk of overweight and obesity, or perhaps from a combination of all these effects. Whatever mechanisms may be at work, this study is consistent with current public health advice to consume substantial quantities of lightly processed plant foods rich in whole-grains and fibre, and to limit consumption of animal products. Importantly for the UK, where type 2 diabetes is a rapidly increasing burden on the NHS, this new analysis suggests that any shift toward this type of dietary pattern could be beneficial.""

"If you were to line up a list of ""unhealthy"" foods in the popular imagination, cheese would probably feature near the top. This dairy favourite has historically been demonised for its high saturated fat content and link to raised cholesterol. Today, though, cheese is enjoying something of a reprieve.

New research from the National Centre for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Obu, Japan looked at the dietary habits of more than 1500 people over the age of 65 in Tokyo. The study found that in cognitive tests, the average score of those who ate cheese was slightly higher than those who didn't.

Cheese consumption was also linked to lower BMI (Body Mass Index) and blood pressure, faster walking speed and a more varied diet overall. Researchers were unable to identify precisely why cheese was linked to the health benefits: one theory is that people who ate cheese simply ate better overall. However, the researchers did note that it was possible cheese may contain nutrients which ""support cognitive function"".

So could there be more health benefits to eating cheese than traditionally thought?

""Cheese has some negatives as it's high in saturated fats which increase 'bad' cholesterol, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes,"" says registered nutritionist Jenna Hope. ""So you don't want to overeat it. On the other hand, it is a good source of protein and it can be very rich in micronutrients, so it can be good for you as part of a balanced diet.""

Dietitian Dr Duane Mellor is senior teaching fellow at Aston University and a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association. ""We do need some fat in our diets,"" Mellor says. ""Fat is a key source of energy at times of food hardship, and it provides padding to protect our vital organs, but it's important for much more than just that. Cholesterol is also used to make steroid hormones the body needs, including vitamin D, sex hormones and cortisol. Finally, it helps transport those vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, D, E and K, which are fat soluble, around the body.""

Alongside offering the vital fats we need, cheese also contains calcium, which is important for bone strength, and B vitamins - including B2 and B12, which help the body release energy from food.

Even though it does contain saturated fats, cheese might not be as dangerous for you as other sources of saturated fat such as red meat. In fact, a 2021 Cambridge study found that people eating dairy were less likely to get cardiovascular illnesses than those who were eating the same amount of saturated fat from red meat. ""Yoghurt and cheese contain vitamin K2 and fermentation products that previous studies have linked to lower heart disease risk,"" the study's co-author Professor Nita Forouhi says.

Next time you visit the cheese aisle, which products should you aim for, and which should you leave on the shelf?

Fermented cheese leads to better gut (and brain) health
""Fermented cheese, such as gruyere, blue and gouda, are made with bacteria including lactococci, streptococci and lactobacilli. These colonise the gut and contribute to higher levels of 'good bacteria' in the gut, which can aid digestion,"" Hope says.

""Encouraging these 'good bacteria' can also reduce inflammation. This is important as, left unchecked, inflammation can damage cells and cause internal scarring."" Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by your gut microbes, is known to help reduce the risk of dementia.

""We're not quite sure why, but it might be because it reduces inflammation in the brain, which may help with long-term brain health and cognitive function,"" says Hope.

Healthy dairy builds stronger bones
""Calcium is really abundant in most cheeses because they're made with milk, which is produced by cows to promote bone development in their calves, and that's really important in building strong bones and teeth for us too,"" Hope says.

Harder cheeses have higher amounts of calcium. In terms of cheeses you'd find in a supermarket, the highest calcium content is found in parmesan, which contains 19 per cent of the daily recommended amount of calcium in each 30g serving. In contrast, a softer cheese like brie contains only 4 per cent.

Protein from cheese helps build muscle
While we tend to get most of our protein from meat, cheese can also be a good source, especially if you are vegetarian. ""I would recommend softer cheeses like mozzarella, feta or cottage cheese,"" Hope says. ""They're lower in saturated fats and thus lower in calories and a good source of protein. Those are the ones we want to incorporate more into our diets.""

Cottage and mozzarella cheeses are among the highest in protein offering, along with parmesan. Both supply about 3-4g of protein per 30g serving, although the latter can contain quite a high salt content, so it is best consumed in smaller quantities.

Some cheeses contain iodine, which is important for cognitive ability
Iodine is a mineral the thyroid gland uses to make hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, specifically in the brain. ""Another reason that the Japanese study may have linked cheese to brain health might be that there's also iodine in some cheeses, which is really important for cognitive function,"" Hope says.

Best cheese for iodine content: Cheddar

Cheeses to avoid
While cheese has many health benefits, you do need to moderate your intake. Both Mellor and Hope advise people try not to eat more than 30-40g of cheese per day, particularly hard cheeses such as Cheddar, parmesan or Wensleydale. ""We used to tell people to eat a portion the size of a match box, but match boxes can be different sizes, so we now suggest half the size of an iPhone,"" Mellor says.

Softer cheeses such as cottage cheese are lower in saturated fats, so Hope says it would not be unhealthy to eat 100g per day of similar cheeses. ""The main thing you have to be mindful of is salt,"" says Mellor. ""That tends to be mostly in blue cheese or stilton styles. Similarly, hard cheeses like Cheddar and red Leicester can be high in saturated fats.""

Hope adds: ""Mass-produced supermarket Cheddar may potentially contain more hormones that have been linked to cancer, so it's important not to overdo it.""";https://www.smh.com.au/goodfood/tips-and-advice/is-cheese-actually-good-for-your-health-you-better-brie-lieve-it-20230929-p5e8n7.html;line list `` unhealthy '' foods popular imagination , cheese would probably feature near top . dairy favourite historically demonised high saturated fat content link raised cholesterol . today , though , cheese enjoying something reprieve . new research national centre geriatrics gerontology obu , japan looked dietary habits 1500 people age 65 tokyo . study found cognitive tests , average score ate cheese slightly higher n't . cheese consumption also linked lower bmi ( body mass index ) blood pressure , faster walking speed varied diet overall . researchers unable identify precisely cheese linked health benefits : one theory people ate cheese simply ate better overall . however , researchers note possible cheese may contain nutrients `` support cognitive function '' . could health benefits eating cheese traditionally thought ? `` cheese negatives 's high saturated fats increase 'bad ' cholesterol , lead heart attacks strokes , '' says registered nutritionist jenna hope . `` n't want overeat . hand , good source protein rich micronutrients , good part balanced diet .

"The idea
The most extreme form of a sugar-free diet restricts all foods that contain added sugars as well as fruit and any vegetables that contain natural sugars such as peas, carrots and parsnips. The less extreme form of the diet permits fruit (but not juices) and vegetables and restricts all added sugars, honey and processed foods that contain sugars such as sugar-sweetened drinks, confectionery, sweet snacks, biscuits, cakes, pastries, ice cream and desserts, sweetened yoghurt, most breakfast cereals, sauces, soups and marinades.
 
Some sugar-free diets claim that sugar is addictive and must be totally eliminated to ‘cure’ the addiction.

The science
All sugars and starches contribute 17 kilojoules/gram. Proteins have the same level of kilojoules – 17/g. Alcohol has more – 29kJ/g and fats contribute the most with 37 kJ/g.

A sugar-free diet will cut kilojoules from sugar itself and also because many foods with added sugar contain starches and fat (for example confectionery, biscuits, cakes, ice cream and desserts). When the diet is effective, it is because total kilojoules fall.


Sugar has no essential nutrients and simply contributes kilojoules. Australia’s Dietary Guidelines have always recommended we limit sugar and research continues to support the need for such a guideline.

Sugar needs to be limited. It adds unnecessary kilojoules, and like refined starches, it increases dental decay. However, there is no evidence that a totally sugar-free diet is needed. The World Health Organization advises limiting added sugars to less than 10% of total energy to prevent dental caries, obesity, and chronic disease. The American Heart Association recommends that added sugars should be limited to less than 5% of total energy intake as a strategy for preventing excess weight (which is a risk factor for heart disease).

There is no scientific support for avoiding fruits and vegetables because of their natural sugar content. These foods also provide dietary fibre (which is nature’s obstacle to overconsumption) as well as minerals and vitamins. Research also shows that consumption of fruit and vegetables helps control weight.

Research shows that fructose is problematic only in excess, and the basic problem in most cases is simply the extra kilojoules from a high intake of fructose. Research also shows that anyone who exercises regularly and pre-menopausal women, will be unlikely to have problems with fructose.

Sugar does not fulfil any official definition of ‘addictive’, although once our taste buds become used to sweetness, some people will overindulge in sweet foods.

How to cut down on sugar
Avoid foods that do not contain any necessary nutrients – for example, soft drinks and confectionery, biscuits and pastries.
Limit cakes and sugary desserts.
Read the ingredient list on breakfast cereals. Best sugar-free choices include oats or a quality muesli (check the ingredient list rather than the total sugars as this will include naturally occurring sugars in dried fruit), or any wholegrain product with less than 3% total sugars.
Read the ingredient list on products such as marinades and sauces. If sugar occurs as one of the first three ingredients, look for a healthier choice or make your own ‘from scratch’ using wine, different flavoured vinegars (for example cider or balsamic) plus extra virgin olive oil, any herbs or spices or garlic or onion.
Choose natural yoghurt and add your own fruit.
Watch out
Sensible eating involves long-term commitment so it’s usually best to avoid going to extremes as this can lead to feelings of deprivation.

"Replacing meat and dairy with whole grains, beans, nuts and olive oil may significantly reduce cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a major review into the impact of diet on health.

Researchers in Germany analysed 37 published studies to assess the benefits of switching from red and processed meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products to plant-based foods such as beans, nuts, whole grains, oils, fruit and vegetables.

They found marked reductions in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and a lower risk of dying from any cause during the periods covered by the studies, especially when red and processed meats were replaced with plant-based foods.

""This evidence highlights the potential benefits of shifting from animal-based diets, including red and processed meat, eggs, dairy, poultry and butter, to plant-based foods like nuts, legumes, whole grains and olive oil,"" said Dr Sabrina Schlesinger, a senior author on the study at the German Diabetes Centre in Düsseldorf.

The risk of cardiovascular disease was about 25% lower when 50g of processed meat a day was replaced with nuts or legumes. Meanwhile, replacing one egg a day with 25g of nuts was linked to a 17% lower risk. But there was no clear evidence that replacing poultry or fish with nuts or legumes reduced cardiovascular disease.

Similar benefits were seen for type 2 diabetes and all causes of death recorded by the studies analysed. The authors calculated a reduction in type 2 diabetes of about 20% when 50g of processed meat daily was swapped for up to 28g of nuts, or when a daily egg was replaced with 30g of whole grains or 10g of nuts.

Replacing processed meat, which was often red meat in the form of ham, bacon, sausages or hotdogs, was linked to the clearest health benefits. According to the study in BMC Medicine, switching 50g of processed meat a day for 28-50g of nuts was associated with a 21% lower risk of death from any cause in the studies assessed.

The research does not delve into the reasons for the observed health benefits, but meat is often rich in saturated fatty acids which are thought to raise the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Processed meat can also have high levels of sodium, nitrates and nitrites. Plant-based foods, on the other hand, are rich in essential nutrients, such as fibre, vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals that dampen inflammation.

Prof Nita Forouhi, an expert in nutrition, diabetes and obesity at the University of Cambridge MRC Epidemiology Unit, said the most convincing findings from the study were for swapping processed and unprocessed red meat with plant-based foods.

One drawback is that the study does not distinguish between different types of dairy. There was some evidence, Forouhi said, that fermented dairy produce, such as yoghurt and cheese, was healthier. Nor did the study look at the benefits of replacing red and processed meat with other animal-based foods such as fish, poultry and eggs. ""Not everyone may wish to be vegan or vegetarian,"" she said.

""The researchers rightly call for further and better-quality research,"" Forouhi added. ""But while this is awaited, it would be prudent to particularly focus on reducing red and processed meat intake, for which the potential adverse health and environmental impacts are greatest.""";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/16/plant-based-swaps-may-cut-diabetes-and-heart-disease-risk-major-review-finds;replacing meat dairy whole grains , beans , nuts olive oil may significantly reduce cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes , according major review impact diet health . researchers germany analysed 37 published studies assess benefits switching red processed meat , poultry , fish , eggs dairy products plant-based foods beans , nuts , whole grains , oils , fruit vegetables . found marked reductions cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes lower risk dying cause periods covered studies , especially red processed meats replaced plant-based foods . `` evidence highlights potential benefits shifting animal-based diets , including red processed meat , eggs , dairy , poultry butter , plant-based foods like nuts , legumes , whole grains olive oil , '' said dr sabrina schlesinger , senior author study german diabetes centre düsseldorf . risk cardiovascular disease 25 % lower 50g processed meat day replaced nuts legumes . meanwhile , replacing one egg day 25g nuts linked 17 % lower risk . clear evidence replacing poultry fish nuts legumes reduced cardiovascular disease . similar benefits seen type 2 diabetes causes death recorded studies analysed . authors calculated reduction type 2 diabetes 20 % 50g processed meat daily swapped 28g nuts , daily egg replaced 30g whole grains 10g nuts . replacing processed meat , often red meat form ham , bacon , sausages hotdogs , linked clearest health benefits . according study bmc medicine , switching 50g processed meat day 28-50g nuts associated 21 % lower risk death cause studies assessed . research delve reasons observed health benefits , meat often rich saturated fatty acids thought raise risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . processed meat also high levels sodium , nitrates nitrites . plant-based foods , hand , rich essential nutrients , fibre , vitamins minerals , antioxidants phytochemicals dampen inflammation . prof nita forouhi , expert nutrition , diabetes obesity university cambridge mrc epidemiology unit , said convincing findings study swapping processed unprocessed red meat plant-based foods . one drawback study distinguish different types dairy . evidence , forouhi said , fermented dairy produce , yoghurt cheese , healthier . study look benefits replacing red processed meat animal-based foods fish , poultry eggs . `` everyone may wish vegan vegetarian , '' said . `` researchers rightly call better-quality research , '' forouhi added . `` awaited , would prudent particularly focus reducing red processed meat intake , potential adverse health environmental impacts greatest .

"The macrobiotic diet has been around for hundreds of years and started as a way to eat that focused on nutrient-dense, seasonal foods harvested locally. This diet also focuses on balancing life, restorative exercise, and the elimination of any chemicals or artificial ingredients in both food and personal health products. Since coming to the United States in the 1970s, the diet has become a bit of a fad, both for good and not so good reasons.

Macrobiotic Diet Basics
The macrobiotic diet has been around since the 4th century BC, started as a concept in ancient Greece by the philosopher Hippocrates. It was then, as it mainly is today, a way of eating seasonal, local foods, mainly plants, exercising outside, sleeping well, and balancing life to the best of one's ability. Prussian physician Dr. Christoph Wilhelm Hufelan was the next to reintroduce the macrobiotic diet in 1796 with his book, Macrobiotics: The Art of Prolonging Life. 

Again this concept faded away until the mid 19th century when, in Japan, Dr. Sagan Ishizuka started incorporating the macrobiotic diet principles into his own practice, which had relied heavily on Western medicine. Ishizuka had witnessed poor health among his army patients who weren't eating well, so he implemented a diet based on unrefined, whole, and fresh seasonal foods, cutting out any artificial ingredients, dairy and non-fish protein. The menu included foods such as whole grains, sea veggies, beans, locally grown and seasonal produce, nuts, seeds, and the occasional fish.

Like the other doctors before him, once Ishizuka died his practice faded away, and once again the macrobiotic diet was somewhat forgotten. That is until the 1920s when George Ohsawa, who was dying of tuberculosis, found Ishizuka's research and decided to try the macrobiotic diet himself. The results were extraordinary and Ohsawa made a full recovery. Ohsawa, along with his wife Lima, started teaching the philosophy and principles behind the macrobiotic diet, and eventually, the concept grew from Japan to Europe, and then all over the world. The macrobiotic diet was well received in the United States thanks to Michio Kushi, a student of Ohsawa and the founder of Erewhon Natural Foods, who popularized it in the 1970s.

The macrobiotic diet has changed over the centuries, and become more of a diet fad and lifestyle. It revolves around three main food principles including: Yin and yang, which, in the context of food, means ingredients that warm up the body also give the body more energy, and are the yang, where yin foods cool us down and can be more refreshing; the second is acid and alkaline, meaning one should consume foods with a high pH balance in order to create an alkaline-forming diet; finally, harmony with nature, one of the main reasons the macrobiotic diet is plant-based. This diet also follows the principles of loving life and following the five elements—fire, wood, water, metal, and earth—though these don't relate to the food as much as they do the lifestyle of the macrobiotic diet.

How to Cook For the Macrobiotic Diet
The main methods of cooking on the macrobiotic diet include steaming, sautéeing, eating raw, boiled, and baking. The main thing to think about when cooking for this diet is what is being prepared.

What to Eat on the Macrobiotic Diet
Grains: The main crux of the macrobiotic diet is whole grains, and many meals contain around 50-percent of this food. This includes anything from millet to quinoa to wheat berries.
Produce: Fresh, seasonal, and locally sourced vegetables are another major part of the diet, especially leafy greens like kale, bok choy, and chard. This part makes up about 30-percent of the daily food intake, and vegetables can be steamed, boiled, sautéed, or baked. There are some who follow the diet that recommend avoiding nightshades such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers, as well as beets, summer squash, and spinach, but these foods are not rigorously prohibited. However non-local fruit is highly discouraged.
Protein: A bit of fresh seafood or fish for protein is allowed, though it's not usually eaten every day. Mostly the protein in the macrobiotic diet comes from beans, especially soybeans. While processed food, in general, isn't part of the diet, soybeans made into tofu, bean curd, or tempeh are allowed. Soy also comes into play in miso form, namely as a soup. A broth-based soup, in fact, is to be eaten twice a day, every day. Lightly roasted and salted nuts and/or seeds too can be added, but no more than one ounce every few days. 
Oils and Spices: To cook foods, avoid olive or coconut oil. Instead, the approved types of cooking oils for the macrobiotic diet include light or dark sesame oil, unrefined vegetable oil, corn oil, or mustard seed oil. Spices can be used and often the macrobiotic diet features Japanese condiments and flavorings such as fermented pickles, shoyu, grated ginger, brown rice and umeboshi vinegars, umeboshi plums, and roasted seaweed. 
What Not to Eat on the Macrobiotic Diet
The main thing to remember when cooking for or following a macrobiotic diet is to eschew chemicals, processed food, dairy, and non-fish meat. The list of banned foods also includes eggs, refined sugar, honey, molasses, coffee, black tea, and alcohol. Once those are eliminated, cooking for the macrobiotic diet doesn't prove difficult. More, it's challenging to plan, and takes effort to prepare the right foods for each meal of the day.
Macrobiotic Diet Recipes 
The basic cooking techniques in the macrobiotic diet are baking, sautéeing, boiling, steaming, and eating raw. These recipes highlight a variety of ingredients approved in the diet as well as methods to make them, though sometimes olive oil has to be substituted for light vegetable oil. 

Mushroom Barley Soup
Macrobiotic Pressed Salad
Collard Greens and Kale
Nutrition and Benefits 
Nutrition is the main reason people go on the macrobiotic diet. It's dense in whole foods, fresh foods, and local produce. There's no sugar, added chemicals, artificial ingredients, caffeine, or alcohol on this diet, all of which can be unhealthy when not consumed in moderation. Due to the lack of meat, nuts, and oils, this diet doesn't give the eater much fat either. While the overall diet plan is nutritious, it may also help with diabetes since there's no added sugar.1 Another way the macrobiotic diet may help the body is by lowering inflammation,2 which can lead to many health problems. 

While overall nutritious, there are a lot of restrictions in the macrobiotic diet that can make it challenging. Another downside to this diet is a lack of protein, iron magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12. Because this diet condones artificial ingredients and additives to foods, finding a vitamin supplement to help balance out these deficients can be difficult. The macrobiotic diet also takes a lot of time and energy to make sure enough of the good foods are getting on the plate, which involves planning, shopping, and mainly cooking at home. 

The Macrobiotic Diet vs. Vegan Diet 
In many respects, the macrobiotic diet is the same as a vegan diet, save for the addition of fish and seafood. The vegan diet doesn't allow for any animal products at all. Both a vegan and macrobiotic diet eschew dairy, meat, eggs, and honey. Overall the macrobiotic diet is more restrictive than a vegan diet since it limits the amount of food one can eat and condones many oils, non-local vegetables and fruit, caffeine, alcohol, and sometimes nightshades. However, unlike the vegan diet, someone on the macrobiotic may wear and buy leather goods. 

Bottom Line
It's both a truth and a myth that the macrobiotic diet is healthy. For starters, there are a lot of healthy aspects to the diet such as portion control, no sugar, lots of vegetables and whole grains, and no artificial ingredients. But it also lacks protein, can be difficult to maintain, and may not be the best diet for all people, especially those sensitive to salt and those who need more good fats in their daily food intake. 

Many people also believe the macrobiotic diet was created by hippies in the 1960s. In fact, this diet dates back hundreds of years to ancient Greece and then Japan, where it really made waves thanks to two doctors who lived almost 100 years apart.

"A no sugar diet, also known as a sugar-free diet, restricts added sugar. This restriction includes obvious sugary foods like candy and soda but added sugar can also be found hiding in savory foods such as pasta sauce. More extreme versions of a no sugar diet may also limit foods with naturally occurring sugar such as fruits and vegetables, but this is not usually recommended as part of a healthy balanced diet.

When diet and nutrition experts reference ""sugary"" foods, they are most often referring to foods that contain lots of added sugar—which is any type of caloric sweetener that's added to foods. (Artificial sweeteners, such as sucralose, are non-caloric.) Sugar provides energy (i.e., calories) but does not offer added nutritional value, which is why calories from sugar are often labeled ""empty calories.""

Excess sugar intake is associated with the rise in obesity in the United States.1?????? The problem with sugary foods begins with eating or drinking too much of them. Foods with added sugars often don't have enough vitamins and minerals to make up for all the extra sugar calories, and as a result, consuming too much of them contributes to weight gain and health problems.

The bottom line is that while a little sugar might be OK, a lot of sugar leads to weight gain and chronic disease.2????? Those who follow a no sugar diet avoid added sugars to promote weight loss and improve their overall health.

What Experts Say
""While there’s no official definition, a no sugar diet typically cuts out added sugar while allowing for natural sugar. Experts agree reducing added sugar intake improves overall health, but clarify that you don’t have to completely eliminate all added sugar for such benefits.""
—Chrissy Carroll, RD, MPH

What Can You Eat?
Since there are several forms and types of sugar, it helps to know what you're looking for. If you see any of these on an ingredients list, the food has added sugars: 

Brown sugar
Corn sugar
Corn syrup
Fructose
Glucose
High fructose corn syrup
Honey (Though a naturally occurring sugar, honey is still considered an added sugar and it contains roughly the same amount of sugar as both high fructose corn syrup and granulated sugar)
Raw sugar
Sucrose
Sugar
Syrup
Turbinado sugar
Artificial sweeteners can offer an alternative to sugar since they contain little to no calories, but there's a lot of controversy surrounding sugar substitutes.3 Many health and nutrition experts have raised questions about whether artificial sweeteners are healthy and safe, and whether they are effective for weight loss. Some have also argued that sugar substitutes are so sweet they actually ramp up your taste buds for sweet foods and drinks.4 On the other hand, some proponents claim that artificial sweeteners can help people transition away from added sugars and cut them out for good.

While there is no one ""official"" no sugar diet, nutrition experts generally agree that the healthiest version of the eating plan cuts out added sugars by focusing on whole foods rather than simply replacing sugar with no-calorie sweeteners.

Look at the Nutrition Facts Label to determine how much added sugar is in each serving. It may be just a small amount, or it might be a lot. 

 56 Different Names for Sugar in Your Food
What You Need to Know
Following a no sugar diet does not mean you have to adhere to a formal eating plan, so there's no advice on meal or snack timing or even the makeup for your meals. You may find, however, that if you are just starting to cut out added sugar, it's best to do it gradually. If you're still facing sugar cravings, drink water and eat (non-sweetened, nutritious) food regularly, so you don't add extreme hunger to your sugar craving. Healthy fats are especially helpful for fighting sugar cravings.

To begin, try to limit your added sugar intake to 100 to 200 calories per day (a tablespoon of honey has about 60 calories and a tablespoon of sugar about 50). The 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines suggest that everyone should limit added sugar intake to 10% of daily calories or less (so, 200 if you're consuming about 2,000 calories a day).5

What to Eat
Foods with no added sugars

Foods that naturally contain sugar

Unsweetened beverages

What Not to Eat
Foods with added sugar

Sweetened beverages

Sugar products including honey and molasses

Be sure to read labels carefully and choose products that have the least or no added sugar. You don't have to give up sweet foods altogether, rather, you'll make healthier choices.

Foods With Natural Sugars

Whole foods that naturally contain sugar aren't off-limits on a balanced no sugar diet. For example, while whole fruits like oranges and pineapple and 100% fruit juices are naturally sweet, they don't have added sugar. (Some research shows that this is confusing to consumers, and understandably so.)6

The exceptions—and likely part of the reason behind the confusion—are products like fruit drinks that do contain added sugar. For example, most cranberry juice beverages are a combination of fruit juices (which naturally contain their own sugars), additional added sugar, and water.

While permitted on a no sugar diet, you may still need to watch the calorie count with the natural sugars like those found in fruit if one of your goals is weight loss. A large glass of fruit juice can have as many calories as the same size glass of sugary soft drink. But at least the juice also offers vitamins and minerals.

Unsweetened Beverages

Soda, lemonade, sweetened iced tea, and many sports and energy drinks contain added sugars and as a result, aren't permitted on a no sugar diet. Proponents of no sugar diets encourage drinking plain or carbonated water, unsweetened tea or coffee, and 100% fruit juice (in moderation).

Foods With Added Sugar

Pastries, cookies, candy bars, syrups, jams, jellies, and pre-sweetened breakfast cereals are all obvious sources of added sugars. But other foods such as salad dressings, sauces, condiments, flavored yogurts, instant oatmeal, fruit smoothies, and even gummy vitamins can also contain added sugars.

For cereal, look for brands that have less than 5 grams of sugar per serving, and choose the ones with the most fiber. Or make your own oatmeal or plain unsweetened cereal and add fruits and berries. Similarly, buy plain yogurt and add fresh fruit.

In general, choose whole foods whenever you can. Processed foods tend to have added sugar, salt, and/or fat. Similarly, simple carbohydrates (such as white flour, white rice, and pasta) don't contain added sugar, but they do break down into sugar quickly in the body. So opt for complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, more often.

Many low-carb diets also limit sugar, and a vegetarian or vegan diet can easily also be a no sugar diet. The best healthy cookbooks are full of low-sugar and no-sugar recipes to inspire you. As with any diet, if you have a health condition such as diabetes, consult with your doctor about the best eating plan for you.

Sample Shopping List
A no sugar diet emphasizes whole fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains, and eliminates foods containing added sugars. While what you eat on this plan is up to you, the following shopping list offers suggestions for getting started. Note that this is not a definitive shopping list and there may be other foods that you prefer.

Lean protein (chicken, cuts of beef, ground beef, salmon, halibut, shrimp)
Dark leafy greens (spinach, kale, Swiss chard, arugula)
Veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, eggplant, carrots)
Whole fruits (grapefruit, oranges, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)
Whole grains (quinoa, barley, amaranth, brown rice, couscous)
Legumes (black beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans)
Healthy fats (avocados, walnuts, almonds, cashews, chia seeds, flaxseeds, olive oil)
Dairy products (milk, feta cheese, parmesan, unsweetened yogurt, cottage cheese)
Eggs
Sample Meal Plan
What you eat on a no sugar diet can depend on whether you have a health condition or have specific weight loss goals. For instance, those on low-carb diets such as keto may avoid most fruits and many complex carbohydrates, which can still be included in other variations of a no sugar eating plan.

The following three-day meal plan is not all-inclusive but should give you a general sense of what a few days on a well-balanced low sugar diet could look like. Note that if you do choose to follow this diet, there may be other meals that work better for you.

Day 1

Breakfast: California summer vegetable omelet; 1 serving spinach and kale green juice; 1/2 cup blackberries
Lunch: 1 1/2 cups citrus, kale, and quinoa salad
Dinner: 4-ounce serving pan-seared salmon with Mediterranean quinoa; 1/2 cup roasted broccoli
Day 2

Breakfast: Spinach and feta oatmeal bowl; 1/2 grapefruit
Lunch: Tuna wrap; 1 cup red curry lentil soup with kale
Dinner: Quinoa stuffed chicken roll-up; 3 ounces spring mix greens with olive oil
Day 3

Breakfast: 1 cup breakfast quinoa topped with fresh mixed berries and almonds
Lunch: 3/4 cup avocado chicken salad; 1 cup rainbow vegetable soup
Dinner: 1 serving grilled Mediterranean shrimp and veggie skewers; 1 cup brown rice or couscous
Pros and Cons
Pros
Practicality

Simplicity

Flexibility

Sustainability

Cons
No formal guidelines or support

Can be challenging

Time-consuming

In addition to health and weight loss benefits, there are other great reasons to reduce the amount of added sugars in your diet. Review the pros and cons to help you decide whether a no sugar diet is right for you.

Pros
Practical and Realistic

Many diets, particularly those touting weight-loss claims, are not always realistic in practice. Some diets make bold claims of rapid weight loss in a short period of time. But more often than not, these plans end up backfiring and any weight loss experienced is likely to be regained once regular eating habits are resumed.

A no sugar diet focused on whole foods teaches healthy lifestyle habits since cutting out added sugar means you're also cutting out many packaged, processed foods containing artificial ingredients. It is a practical lifestyle to adhere to for not just weight loss but long-term weight management and overall health.

Simple to Follow

A no sugar diet does not have any timelines, guidelines, rules, or restrictions (aside from cutting out added sugars). There are no books to buy (unless you want to learn more) or products or supplements to subscribe to, nor is it promoted by a single celebrity or public figure. All you have to do is avoid added sugar by eating whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible, making this an easy-to-follow plan.

Flexible and Adaptable

Because there are no hard and fast rules on a no sugar diet, what you eat is up to your personal preferences and budget, and the plan is adaptable to suit your lifestyle. In addition, as you slowly wean yourself off sugar and your body starts to naturally crave more nutritious foods, a no sugar diet can encourage mindful, intuitive eating. In time, adhering to the no sugar lifestyle can become like second nature rather than a temporary fix or short-term diet.

Long-Term Sustainability

It's healthy and safe to eat this way indefinitely, and sugar cravings should fade over time. As long as you stick with whole foods and read labels carefully, you may find it easy to stick to this diet for the long term.

Following a no sugar diet (or even a low sugar diet) should offer health benefits including weight loss. But it can be difficult to fully cut added sugar from your diet.

Cons
No Guidelines to Follow

Since it's not a formal plan, a no sugar diet has few guidelines other than cutting out added sugars as completely as possible. There's no calorie or carb counting here, or even recommendations for portion control. While this can be a benefit to those seeking a less regimented eating plan to follow, some people may need more structure and parameters in order to meet their weight loss and health goals. For instance, without any calorie requirements to meet, it's still possible to overeat on this plan.

Challenging

Setting aside the common American taste for sugar, there is sugar hiding in many foods (some of them quite unexpected). Distinguishing added sugars from natural sugars can be difficult. As a rule of thumb, your best bet is to stick with real, whole foods and limit many packaged convenience foods. Always read labels carefully to look for added sugars.

Time-Consuming

While following a no-sugar lifestyle is undeniably healthy, keep in mind that you will have to do a lot more meal prep, planning, and cooking. For those who may not have that kind of time, a no sugar diet may not be the most realistic choice.

Is the No Sugar Diet a Healthy Choice for You?
Many low-carb eating plans also limit sugar, so those plans can resemble a no sugar diet in some ways. And cutting sugar also aligns with government advice on healthy eating. The USDA's dietary guidelines suggest a balanced mix of fruits, grains, vegetables, protein, and dairy products. There's no space for added sugars, but they're also not strictly prohibited.

If weight loss is one of your goals, you may need to count calories in addition to cutting back on added sugars. Avoiding those sugars will likely result in consuming fewer calories altogether, but to know for sure, use this tool to calculate a daily calorie goal, and then an app or journal to track your progress meeting that goal.
USDA guidelines suggest limiting your sugar intake to no more than 10% of your daily calories.5?? Once you get there, you can gradually reduce your consumption of added sugars even more.

Health Benefits
Many weight loss plans restrict sugar since it's an effective way to cut out empty (non-nutritious) calories. Doing that should help you lose weight. And whole, nutrient-dense foods tend to be more filling, so it's possible to eat less of them and still feel full.

A no sugar diet can also help people avoid other health risks that go along with high sugar intake. For example, one research review listed three studies that showed consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased blood pressure, inflammatory markers, total cholesterol, and visceral (belly) fat.7

Mounting evidence continues to show a number of positive health outcomes from cutting back on added sugars, including a reduction in the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.88

In addition, too much sugar can increase your risk of dental problems.9 So a no-sugar diet should help lower your risk of dental decay. 

Health Risks
While there are no common health risks associated with a diet low in added sugar, restrictive eating plans can sometimes lead to unhealthy eating habits or an extreme obsession with healthy eating. To that end, it's important to make sure you're still getting enough calories each day from nutrient-dense foods to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

A Word From Verywell
If you are looking to lose weight or simply improve your health, cutting added sugars could be a smart and fairly simple choice. For weight loss, you might also consider adding more fiber. But remember that weight loss is a complex process that should also include exercise, stress management, and other lifestyle factors. Discuss your plans with your physician to help create a plan that meets your needs.

Remember, following a long-term or short-term diet may not be necessary for you and many diets out there simply don’t work, especially long-term. While we do not endorse fad diet trends or unsustainable weight loss methods, we present the facts so you can make an informed decision that works best for your nutritional needs, genetic blueprint, budget, and goals.

If your goal is weight loss, remember that losing weight isn’t necessarily the same as being your healthiest self, and there are many other ways to pursue health. Exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle factors also play a major role in your overall health.

"Consuming whole grains, like whole grain bread, brown rice, and quinoa, instead of their refined counterparts may result in improved health outcomes, according to new data.1

Research has already established that consuming whole grains is linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and gastrointestinal cancers.1 For this November study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, researchers aimed to determine whether whole grain consumption improved cardiovascular outcomes compared to refined grains (like white bread and white rice) or placebo in adults.

From the data, researchers concluded that for adults with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, consuming certain whole grain as opposed to refined grain may improve:

Total cholesterol
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
Hemoglobin A1C (an indicator of blood glucose control)
C-reactive protein (a biomarker for inflammation)
Additionally, consuming whole grain rice (like brown rice) decreased triglycerides. Having elevated triglycerides can increase your risk of developing heart disease.2

Although these are all positive outcomes, it does not appear that consumption of whole grains can be recommended as a direct way to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to these results.

Whole Grain Health Benefits
The term ""whole grain"" is tossed around a lot as a good-for-you choice on the internet and food packaging, but there can be some confusion as to what whole grains really are.

""A whole grain has three parts attached to it—the bran, endosperm, and germ,"" Christina Brown, RDN, a registered dietitian based in New Jersey, tells Verywell. The bran and germ are nutrition powerhouses—containing nutrients like fiber, magnesium, selenium, and a slew of other beneficial properties. 

While consuming whole grains may not reduce your risk of developing CVD, it may help reduce your risk of dying if you are diagnosed with CVD, according to data from 2016.3??

Specifically, the data suggests that for every 16-gram serving of whole grains (approximately one serving; equal to one slice of whole grain bread or half a cup of brown rice), cardiovascular-related deaths declined by 9%. And when 48 grams of whole grains were consumed (three servings) every day, rates of cardiovascular death declined by 25%.3??

This echoes results obtained from the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study, suggesting that women who ate two to three servings of whole grains each day were 30% less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease over a 10-year period than women who ate less than one serving of whole grains per week.4

?Should You Avoid Refined Grains?
While consumption of whole grains is linked to a slew of benefits, there may be unique benefits to including certain refined grains like rice and pasta in your diet as well.

""When considered on their own as opposed to part of an unhealthy eating plan, there is no evidence to link refined grains with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or high blood pressure,""5?? Elizabeth Ward, MS, RDN, a registered dietitian based in Boston, Massachusetts, and co-author of The Menopause Diet Plan: A Natural Guide to Managing Hormones, Health, and Happiness, tells Verywell. ""Everyday staple foods [and refined grains], such as bread, cereal, and pasta, are significant sources of B vitamins—including folic acid, which helps prevent birth defects—and iron.""

Ward says that whole grains are not typically fortified with B vitamins and iron. 

Because of this, experts don't suggest totally eliminating refined grains from your diet.

How to Include Whole Grains In a Healthy Diet
Consumption of whole grains remains low in the U.S. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020, the average intake of whole grains was far below recommended levels across all age-sex groups, while average intake of refined grains was well above recommended limits for most age-sex groups.6?

Examples of whole grain foods include:

Whole grain bread
Whole wheat
Stoneground whole grain crackers
Brown rice
Oats
Quinoa
To incorporate more whole grains into your diet, easy strategies include:

Snacking on air-popped popcorn
Making a sandwich on whole grain bread instead of white
Plating dinner on a small bed of brown rice instead of white

"Following a Mediterranean-style diet that includes lean beef can offer heart-health benefits, according to a new study.1

Researchers aimed to challenge the assumption that a heart-healthy diet, like the popular and largely plant-based Mediterranean diet, can't include red meat.

""This study demonstrates that we can incorporate lean beef into a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern by replacing some of the traditional protein sources with lean beef and see beneficial health effects on markers associated with cardiovascular disease risk,"" study author David J. Baer, PhD, a supervisory research physiologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tells Verywell.

Previous observational studies suggest that red meat, like beef, does not support heart health.2 However, because these results were not based on controlled trials, but rather founded on observations, their results may not be as reliable. Many studies also classified all red meats, including processed meats and fatty choices, in the same group as lean choices.

""Beef is a source of some important nutrients that are not readily available from some other protein sources,"" Baer explains. ""Beef can provide these nutrients, and when consumed as part of Mediterranean-style dietary pattern, there is potential to benefit from the other healthful components of that dietary pattern."" 

This study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in April and was funded by the Beef Checkoff. 

Can You Eat Beef When Following a Mediterranean-Style Diet?
Following a Mediterranean diet can support heart health.3 This diet is heavily plant-based, including nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, fruit, and vegetables.

On this diet, red meat should be a much smaller proportion of your weekly food intake than plants-about 2.5-ounce protein equivalents per week, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.4 

But researchers sought to find whether eating more than the weekly ""permitted"" amount would negatively impact cholesterol levels.

To do this, each group of participants was provided with one of four diets:

Mediterranean (MED) diet with 0.5 oz. of beef a day
Mediterranean (MED) diet with 2.5 oz. of beef a day
Mediterranean (MED) diet with 5.5 oz. of beef a day
An average American diet with 2.5 oz. of beef (used as a control diet)
All three Mediterranean diets included olive oil as the predominant fat source, three to six servings of fruits, and six or more servings of vegetables a day. The beef included in these diets was either lean or extra-lean.

Each group consumed all four diets for four weeks each. Blood samples were taken before and after each session to evaluate changes in blood lipid levels. 

Researchers found that after following any of the Mediterranean diets that included beef, participants had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol) levels compared to when they followed the average American diet. This difference was only statistically significant for the groups who ate the lowest amounts of lean beef.

Mike Roussell, PhD, a nutrition strategist based in New York, explains that this statistical difference may be due to the researchers' need to replace other foods with beef in order to ""fit"" the right amount of beef into this experimental diet, potentially causing this effect.

This data reiterates that there isn't just once food that causes LDL cholesterol to increase.

""When thinking about our health, we need to continue to consider our whole dietary pattern and all of the combinations of foods that we consume,"" Baer explains. ""It's not just one food but it's all the foods that matter.""

This isn't the first time researchers say that lean beef can be a part of a healthy eating pattern. In 2012, Roussell led a study evaluating the consumption of different amounts of lean beef in conjunction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. His team found that following this dietary pattern and eating lean beef offered positive effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

How to Include Beef in a Mediterranean-Style Diet
Beef is a source of high-quality protein and key nutrients like iron and zinc. While certain choices can be high in sodium and saturated fat, there are plenty of lean options that can be a part of an overall healthy diet. 
Some lean choices of beef include:

Eye of round roast and steak
Sirloin tip side steak
Top round roast and steak
Bottom round roast and steak
Top sirloin steak
Flank steak
When shopping for beef: 

Choose cuts that are graded ""Choice"" or ""Select"" instead of ""Prime,"" which may have more fat.
Choose cuts with the least amount of marbling
When selecting ground beef, opt for the lowest percentage of fat
When preparing dishes with beef, combine them with other foods incorporated in the Mediterranean diet. Try eating baked lean-beef meatballs over a bed of quinoa drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and crushed walnuts-served with a side of mixed greens. You can also experiment with homemade meat sauce over whole grain pasta and sauteed spinach.

Bottom line: If you are trying to support your heart health and you love the taste of beef, incorporating lean options in a Mediterranean-style diet that is rich in nutrient-dense foods appears to be a safe bet.";https://www.verywellhealth.com/mediterranean-diet-lean-beef-5184005;following mediterranean-style diet includes lean beef offer heart-health benefits , according new study.1 researchers aimed challenge assumption heart-healthy diet , like popular largely plant-based mediterranean diet , ca n't include red meat . `` study demonstrates incorporate lean beef mediterranean-style dietary pattern replacing traditional protein sources lean beef see beneficial health effects markers associated cardiovascular disease risk , '' study author david j. baer , phd , supervisory research physiologist u.s. department agriculture , tells verywell . previous observational studies suggest red meat , like beef , support heart health.2 however , results based controlled trials , rather founded observations , results may reliable . many studies also classified red meats , including processed meats fatty choices , group lean choices . `` beef source important nutrients readily available protein sources , '' baer explains . `` beef provide nutrients , consumed part mediterranean-style dietary pattern , potential benefit healthful components dietary pattern .

"Whether red meat should be included in your diet continues to be a subject of debate. While red meat provides key nutrients, such as protein, zinc, iron, and vitamin B12, some studies have linked high red meat consumption to conditions such as heart disease and cancer.

Experts suggest limiting red meat to no more than three servings per week. This article reviews the potential benefits and risks of including red meat in your diet.

Effects of Red Meat: Split Health Recommendations
When it comes to the possible health effects of red meat, experts seem to be split on whether it's OK to eat red meat or if you should limit it in your diet. Some scientists suggest the cut of red meat, how it is cooked and/or processed, as well as how much you eat may play a role.

Most studies on red meat and health have been observational, meaning they can't prove causation but rather just an association. Because of this, there may be additional confounding factors within the studies that influence the results.

It's important to keep this in mind when considering the research and how you will apply it to your individual diet.

Possible Negative Effects of Red Meat 
Heart Disease

Red meat has long been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.1 One large study observed red and processed meat intake in over 43,000 males. The researchers concluded that higher red meat consumption (both processed and unprocessed) increased the risk of heart disease.2

The study also suggested substituting plant protein foods, such as nuts, legumes, and soy, for red meat might reduce the associated risk. Substituting whole grains and dairy products for total red meat intake and substituting eggs for processed meats also seemed to reduce heart disease risk.2
An even larger study of over 134,000 people compared unprocessed vs. processed meat intake across 21 countries. The study concluded that eating 5.3 ounces or more of processed meat per week was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease and mortality.3
The researchers found no significant associations between unprocessed meats and poultry and heart disease. However, a 2017 meta-analysis of 24 studies on total red meat intake and heart-related risk status concluded that eating half a serving or more of red meat per day did not significantly influence blood cholesterol or blood pressure levels.4

Cancer

Red meat has been linked to an increased risk for cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research reports that eating more than 18 ounces of red meat weekly can increase your cancer risk.5

A 2018 review of studies compared consumption of red and processed meat with breast cancer risk. The study found that individuals who had a high intake of processed meat had a 9% increased risk of developing breast cancer. Furthermore, those with a high intake of unprocessed meats had a 6% increased risk of breast cancer.6

Another review of studies looked at red meat intake and the risk of developing colorectal cancer. After reviewing meta-analyses reviews, the study's authors concluded that red and processed meats may increase colorectal cancer risk by 20% to 30%.7
A 2021 review of studies looking at red and processed meat intake and the risk of several types of cancer concluded that high red meat intake increased the risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, colon, rectal, and lung cancers, as well as a common type of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The researchers also found that high processed meat intake was associated with an increased risk of breast, colorectal, colon, rectal, and lung cancers.8

Type 2 Diabetes

Some research suggests that high red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. A 2021 review of studies compared individuals with the lowest and highest intakes of processed and unprocessed red meats. The authors found that those who had the highest intakes of processed and unprocessed red meats were 27% and 15% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, respectively.9
A 2017 review examined the risk of type 2 diabetes and 12 major food groups. Red meat and processed meat were found to have a significant relation with the risk of type 2 diabetes, with the risk increasing with increased consumption.10
Two other studies11 similarly concluded that replacing red meat with other protein sources may decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.12 However, additional studies are needed to assess the association between red meat and the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Possible Positive Effects of Red Meat 
Red meat is high in important nutrients, including protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12, and other B vitamins such as niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine. 

For example, red meat may be beneficial to help prevent and treat iron-deficiency anemia due to its highly bioavailable (the amount of a nutrient that is able to be absorbed and used in the body) heme-iron.13 Iron (as part of hemoglobin in red blood cells) carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and helps make some hormones in the body.14

Red meat is an excellent source of protein, containing around 20 to 25 grams (g) of protein in every 100 g of meat. Protein helps build and repair muscles and other cells in the body. Protein also aids in satiety (helps you feel full after eating), fighting infection, carrying nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, keeping body fluids balanced, and clotting blood.15
Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products, and red meat is a good source of it. Vitamin B12 helps make DNA (the genetic materials in all your cells), keeps your blood and nerve cells healthy, and helps prevent another type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia.16

Zinc helps keep your immune system strong, aids in wound healing, and helps the body grow during important life stages, including pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc is also important for proper sense of taste.17 Meat is a rich source of bioavailable zinc.

Other Factors in the ""Red Meat Is Bad"" Debate
Several factors may play a role in why red meat should be limited in your diet. From how the meat is cooked to how it is processed can influence the way it affects your health.

Cooking Methods
High heat cooking methods and those that expose the meat directly to flames, such as grilling or pan-frying, may produce more of certain types of cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens).18 Cooking methods that expose meat to smoke also contribute formation of these potential carcinogens in the meat.19
Instead, opt for cooking your meat at lower temperatures and don't cook directly over an open flame. Additionally, limit consumption of charred and smoked meat, and cut off any burnt portions of meat. If you do choose to expose your meat directly to open flames, marinate it beforehand, frequently turn or flip the meat over instead of letting it sit on one side for an extended period.

Processing
Whether red meat is processed seems to play a role in the debate on if it should be included in your diet.

While all red meat is ""processed"" to some extent, such as by slaughtering and packaging, the term ""processed meat"" generally refers to meat that has been preserved by salting, smoking, curing, fermenting, or adding chemical preservatives.20 Examples include hot dogs, bacon, sausage, deli meats, pepperoni, and salami.

The high salt content of processed meats may be partly to blame for more association with heart disease risk. High sodium intake has been linked to high blood pressure.21
Another reason for the possible negative health effects of processed meats is due to nitrates and nitrites that are often used, which have been linked22 to increased cancer risk.23 Limiting or avoiding processed meats in the diet is recommended.5

Fat Content
Red meat is often high in saturated fat. Saturated fat can raise levels of both total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (considered bad cholesterol), increasing your risk of heart disease.24 The American Heart Association recommends choosing lean cuts of meat, if choosing to include red meat in your diet.23
Lean cuts of red meat include beef and pork labeled ""loin"" and ""round,"" and using ""choice"" or ""select"" grades of beef rather than ""prime.""  In addition, trim any visible fat off the edges of the meat prior to cooking. For ground meat, choose 95% extra lean ground beef. For ground beef that is 90% lean or less, drain the fat after browning.25

What's Considered Red Meat?
Red meat is meat from mammals that is red when raw. This is because it contains more of the protein myoglobin than white meat, such as chicken and fish.

Red meat includes:

Beef
Bison
Boar
Elk
Goat
Lamb
Mutton
Pork
Veal
Venison
However, game meat, such as venison and elk, tend to be leaner than beef and pork due to the animals' active lifestyles and diet.26 Because of this, meat from these sources tends to be lower in saturated and total fat compared to beef and pork and may not carry the same associated health risks.

Red Meat Serving Size and Weekly Allowance 
Both the World Cancer Research Fund International27 and the American Institute for Cancer Research5 recommend limiting consumption of red meat to no more than three (4 to 6 ounces cooked weight) servings per week, for a total of 12 to 18 ounces of cooked red meat weekly. Additionally, they recommend consuming very little, if any, processed meat.

They note that their recommendation doesn't mean completely cutting red meat from your diet. Red meat can be a valuable source of important nutrients, including zinc, iron, protein, and vitamin B12. 

Choosing leaner cuts of red meat and using healthier cooking methods while including a variety of other nutrient-rich foods in your diet is a good way to include red meat in a balanced eating pattern.

Who Should Limit Red Meat in Their Diet?
People with or at risk of certain health conditions may be recommended to reduce red meat even further in their diets than the above-mentioned recommendations. This includes individuals at risk of heart failure or stroke, including those with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or a family history of cardiovascular (heart) disease or type 2 diabetes.

People who need to restrict nutrients that are high in red meat may need to limit their intake of red meat. For example, some people with kidney disease may need to moderate the amount of protein they consume to prevent further kidney damage.28 Others, such as those with gout, may also need to limit red meat intake due to its high purine content.29
The American Heart Association suggests that, in general, substituting more plant protein for red meat, especially processed red meat, appears to be a good approach for a healthier diet and better overall health.30
Summary
Red meat is rich in important nutrients, including protein, zinc, iron, and B vitamins. However, high consumption has also been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, some cancers, and type 2 diabetes. Red meat includes meats from mammals that are red when raw, most commonly beef and pork. 

The way red meat is processed and cooked, and the fat content, may influence the effect on health. Choosing leaner cuts of meat and limiting high heat and smoking cooking methods may be better options.

Experts recommend limiting red meat intake to no more than 12 to 18 ounces of cooked red meat per week and limiting or avoiding processed meats. People who are at risk of or have certain health conditions, such as heart failure, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure, may be recommended to reduce red meat even further in their diets.";https://www.verywellhealth.com/red-meat-bad-for-you-8414588;"whether red meat included diet continues subject debate . red meat provides key nutrients , protein , zinc , iron , vitamin b12 , studies linked high red meat consumption conditions heart disease cancer . experts suggest limiting red meat three servings per week . article reviews potential benefits risks including red meat diet . effects red meat : split health recommendations comes possible health effects red meat , experts seem split whether 's ok eat red meat limit diet . scientists suggest cut red meat , cooked and/or processed , well much eat may play role . studies red meat health observational , meaning ca n't prove causation rather association . , may additional confounding factors within studies influence results .

"We analyse global research on how consuming meat, fish and dairy products affects the risk of developing cancer.

OUR MAJOR FINDINGS ON CANCER AND ANIMAL FOODS
There is strong evidence that consuming:

red meat INCREASES the risk of colorectal cancer
processed meat INCREASES the risk of colorectal cancer
Cantonese-style salted fish INCREASES the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer
dairy products DECREASE the risk of colorectal cancer
How does eating meat, fish and dairy affect your risk of cancer?
For red meat, processed meat and Cantonese-style salted fish the evidence shows that, in general, the more people consume, the higher the risk of some cancers. In contrast, the evidence shows that, in general, the more dairy products people consume, the lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

For people who eat meat, eat no more than moderate amounts of red meat, such as beef, pork and lamb, and eat little, if any, processed meat
- This is the opinion of our Expert Panel

Cancer Prevention Recommendation
> Limit consumption of red and processed meat

A global recommendation about consumption of Cantonese-style salted fish has not been made, as this type of fish is consumed only in specific parts of the world. Nevertheless, the Panel advises that Cantonese-style salted fish should not be consumed.

The Panel did not base a recommendation on the strong evidence that the consumption of dairy products decreases the risk of colorectal cancer as there is some other evidence that is suggestive of an increased risk of prostate cancer, although that evidence fell below the general threshold required for making a recommendation.

What are foods from animal sources?
Animal foods is a term used to describe all foods of animal origin. These foods may be derived from the animal flesh itself (for example, meat, fish and  poultry), or foods that are produced by animals (for example, eggs, as well as dairy products such as milk, and products made from milk including  cheese, butter, ghee and yoghurt).

Animal foods are generally a good source of protein, but the fat content varies according to the specific species from which they are derived. Dairy products are a good source of calcium. Consumption of foods such as red meat and fish generally increases with economic development, whereas consumption of dairy products is variable, particularly in Asia where many populations are lactose intolerant.

Animal foods such as meat and fish may be processed before consumption by smoking, curing, salting or by adding preservatives. Meat and fish are also often cooked using very high temperatures during frying, grilling (broiling) or barbecuing (charbroiling). These methods of processing and preparation may affect the chemical composition as well as the nutritional value of animal foods.

"Sugar comes in many forms and is found in a wide variety of foods. All forms of sugar are simple carbohydrates that our bodies use for energy. Although naturally occurring sugars in foods like fruit and dairy can be part of a healthy diet, too much added sugar can be harmful to health, especially for people with diabetes. 

According to the American Heart Association, healthy adults should aim for less than 36 grams of sugar per day for men and less than 25 grams per day for women.

Why You Should Eat Less Sugar
Added sugars contribute additional calories to food without also contributing nutrients. As a result, people trying to lose weight may want to avoid foods high in sugar. People with conditions that affect blood sugar control, like diabetes, should also avoid sugary foods. 

Sugar has an effect on many body systems, including:

Weight Management

Adding sugar to foods and beverages increases their caloric density without also increasing their nutritional value. Sweetening foods also makes them easier to overeat. This may make it difficult to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. 

Added sugars in the diet are associated with a higher risk of developing type II diabetes. For adults with diabetes, consuming too much sugar can also interfere with blood sugar control. 

Oral Health

All forms of sugar allow bacteria to multiply and grow, promoting tooth decay. Consuming foods and beverages with either natural or added sugars increases the chances that you will develop cavities, especially if you don't practice good oral hygiene. 

Foods With Sugar
Sugar comes in a variety of forms, from naturally occurring sugars to sweeteners like cane sugar and corn syrup. These eight foods are some of the most concentrated sources of sugar. 

1. Cane Sugar

Cane sugar is the most popular form of sugar found in packaged foods, baked goods, and some soft drinks. Cane sugar is derived from the sugar cane plant and contains sucrose, which is broken down into glucose and fructose in the body, thereby evoking an insulin response.

2. Honey

Honey is often considered a healthier alternative to cane sugar because it is harvesting naturally from bee hives and has some nutritional value. Fructose, which is sweeter than sucrose or glucose, is the main sugar found in honey. Although honey may have some health benefits, it should still be enjoyed in moderation. 

3. Agave

Some people have begun replacing cane sugar with agave syrup because it is purportedly lower on the glycemic index and therefore less likely to spike insulin. However, this has not been well supported by the research. Like honey, agave contains a higher percentage of fructose than cane sugar. 

4. Corn Syrup

Corn syrup, especially high-fructose corn syrup, has been implicated in the rise of obesity in the United States. This may be because the fructose in corn syrup doesn't signal satiety the way that an equal number of calories would when consumed in a different form.

5. Brown Rice Syrup

Brown rice syrup or malt syrup is derived by breaking down the starches in cooked rice. Very little research has been done on the health effects of brown rice syrup, but it is sometimes used as an alternative to corn syrup in baking and packaged foods. 

6. Dairy

Lactose is the naturally occurring form of sugar in dairy products. Many adults have a lactose intolerance, making dairy sugars difficult to digest. 

7. Fruit

All fruits contain some amount of naturally occurring sugars, or fructose. Some fruits, like bananas, are higher in sugar than others, like berries. Because the fructose in fruit is accompanied by fiber, it slows down your body's insulin response, making it a healthier alternative to added sugars.

8. Coconut Sugar

Coconut sugar, or palm sugar, is a sweetener derived from the sap of the palm tree. It has recently gained in popularity as a believed healthier alternative to cane sugar, although there is not enough research yet to support this claim. Like all sugars, coconut sugar should be used in moderation. 

Sugar-Free Alternatives
If you'd like to reduce your sugar intake, look for “no sugar added” on food packages. These products may still contain natural sugar in the foods used to make them, but they won't contain sugar added for taste. The following foods are great options for a low or no sugar diet:

1. Vegetables

Compared to fruits, most vegetables contain less sugar. The amount of sugar in different types of vegetables vary. Mushrooms, spinach, kale, soybean sprouts, celery, broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, radishes, and asparagus are among the vegetables with the lowest sugar content available.

2. Meat

Seafood, pork, beef, and chicken are all sugar-free. They're also an important source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

3. Beans, Nuts, Lentils

If you don't eat meat, soybeans, lentils, beans, nuts, and seeds are great sugar-free, high-protein foods.

4. Grains

Brown rice, quinoa, and oats are tasty, low-sugar foods that will help you meet your daily recommended fiber intake.";https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-sugar;sugar comes many forms found wide variety foods . forms sugar simple carbohydrates bodies use energy . although naturally occurring sugars foods like fruit dairy part healthy diet , much added sugar harmful health , especially people diabetes . according american heart association , healthy adults aim less 36 grams sugar per day men less 25 grams per day women . eat less sugar added sugars contribute additional calories food without also contributing nutrients . result , people trying lose weight may want avoid foods high sugar . people conditions affect blood sugar control , like diabetes , also avoid sugary foods . sugar effect many body systems , including : weight management adding sugar foods beverages increases caloric density without also increasing nutritional value . sweetening foods also makes easier overeat . may make difficult lose weight maintain healthy weight . added sugars diet associated higher risk developing type ii diabetes . adults diabetes , consuming much sugar also interfere blood sugar control . oral health forms sugar allow bacteria multiply grow , promoting tooth decay . consuming foods beverages either natural added sugars increases chances develop cavities , especially n't practice good oral hygiene . foods sugar sugar comes variety forms , naturally occurring sugars sweeteners like cane sugar corn syrup . eight foods concentrated sources sugar . 1. cane sugar cane sugar popular form sugar found packaged foods , baked goods , soft drinks . cane sugar derived sugar cane plant contains sucrose , broken glucose fructose body , thereby evoking insulin response . 2. honey honey often considered healthier alternative cane sugar harvesting naturally bee hives nutritional value . fructose , sweeter sucrose glucose , main sugar found honey . although honey may health benefits , still enjoyed moderation . 3. agave people begun replacing cane sugar agave syrup purportedly lower glycemic index therefore less likely spike insulin . however , well supported research . like honey , agave contains higher percentage fructose cane sugar . 4. corn syrup corn syrup , especially high-fructose corn syrup , implicated rise obesity united states . may fructose corn syrup n't signal satiety way equal number calories would consumed different form . 5. brown rice syrup brown rice syrup malt syrup derived breaking starches cooked rice . little research done health effects brown rice syrup , sometimes used alternative corn syrup baking packaged foods . 6. dairy lactose naturally occurring form sugar dairy products . many adults lactose intolerance , making dairy sugars difficult digest . 7. fruit fruits contain amount naturally occurring sugars , fructose . fruits , like bananas , higher sugar others , like berries . fructose fruit accompanied fiber , slows body 's insulin response , making healthier alternative added sugars . 8. coconut sugar coconut sugar , palm sugar , sweetener derived sap palm tree . recently gained popularity believed healthier alternative cane sugar , although enough research yet support claim . like sugars , coconut sugar used moderation . sugar-free alternatives 'd like reduce sugar intake , look “ sugar added ” food packages . products may still contain natural sugar foods used make , wo n't contain sugar added taste . following foods great options low sugar diet : 1. vegetables compared fruits , vegetables contain less sugar . amount sugar different types vegetables vary . mushrooms , spinach , kale , soybean sprouts , celery , broccoli , cucumber , cauliflower , radishes , asparagus among vegetables lowest sugar content available . 2. meat seafood , pork , beef , chicken sugar-free .

"Parmesan
Lactose intolerant? Give parmesan a try. In just 1 (grated) ounce, this low-lactose choice delivers 8 grams of protein, 119 calories, and only 3 carbs, without causing tummy trouble. Plus, it's high in calcium and phosphorus, nutrients that help build bone.

Goat Cheese
It's often easier to digest than cheese made from cow's milk because it has different proteins that don't irritate your digestive system. It also has a higher percentage of medium-chain fatty acids, which your body absorbs quickly instead of storing, the way it does with other types of fats.

Feta
This tasty cheese is low in both calories and fat while packing a vitamin B punch. Other nutrients it brings to the table include vitamins A and K, folate, pantothenic acid, iron, and magnesium.

Vegan 'Cheese'
In general, vegan diets can improve gut health and increase your fiber intake. Cheese made from plant-based options such as soy, nuts, seeds, or coconut can be a healthy choice, but pay attention to labels. Some vegan products are overly processed, which takes away from their healthy potential.

Blue Cheese
This tangy, smelly treat is a solid source of calcium. Just one ounce has 15% of your daily recommended value.

Cottage Cheese
This power cheese is packed with nutrients like protein, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium. It's also low in cholesterol and a good source of riboflavin. But it often comes with a load of sodium, so read labels and look for brands that have a lower amount.

Mozzarella
If you're looking for a low-sodium, low-calorie cheese, mozzarella is a smart pick. You also get a dose of probiotics in each serving from the healthy bacteria inside.

Ricotta
The whey in creamy ricotta boasts amino acids -- the building blocks of all proteins in your body. Whey is also good for building muscle, lowering blood pressure, and reducing cholesterol.

Farmer Cheese
Farmer cheese is cottage cheese that's pressed to remove most of the moisture. Because it has less liquid, it also has little to no calcium. But it's low in calories, sodium, and fat while offering a good amount of protein.

Extra-Sharp Cheddar
When you want cheese but don't want to go overboard on calories, opt for a high-flavor option like sharp cheddar. It can satisfy your flavor craving with just a small, bold dose. In addition, all of these cheeses are available in low-fat versions.

"Zinc is a trace mineral, which means you only need a very small amount of it every day. You can get this essential nutrient by eating a balanced diet, but sometimes you may need to take a zinc supplement. 

Impact of Zinc on Your Health
Your body needs zinc to function properly. If you don't get enough, you could develop health problems. Your body uses zinc to do the following: 

?Heal wounds
Support the function of your immune system
Develop your reproductive system 
Develop your sense of taste and smell 
Produce and store insulin 
Help your thyroid and metabolism work properly
Make proteins and DNA
?Zinc has also been shown in some studies to improve the following conditions: 

?Common cold 
?Diarrhea 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
Getting the right amount of zinc is especially important as you grow. Children and teens need to have zinc in their diet. 


Zinc is a vital nutrient in pregnancy. It helps with the proper development of the fetus. People who breastfeed also need more zinc in their diet than usual. 

?Most people get enough zinc from the food they eat. The following groups are at risk of zinc deficiency. 

?People with digestive disorders like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The body often can't absorb zinc well when experiencing these conditions. 
?People who follow a vegetarian diet. Meat is a good source of zinc, and vegetarian protein sources like legumes can prevent zinc from being absorbed. 
?Infants older than 6 months who breastfeed. Breast milk doesn't have enough zinc for a baby over 6 months of age. Adding another source of zinc into their diet is necessary. Formula usually contains enough zinc for older infants. ?
People who struggle with alcoholism. Alcohol can prevent your body from absorbing zinc. People with alcoholism often don't have a well-balanced diet that includes enough zinc.

Sources of Zinc
You can usually get enough zinc through your diet. The best food sources of zinc are: 

?Oysters, crab, and lobster
Red meat
Pork 
Chicken and other poultry
Nuts, whole grains, and beans
Dairy products
Fortified foods like breakfast cereal

So how much zinc do you need? Men need 11 milligrams/day of zinc, while women need 8 milligrams/day. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding often need about 11 to 12 milligrams/day. 

Zinc requirements vary in childhood and teenage years: 

Babies aged 0 to 6 months need 2 milligrams/day
Infants aged 7 months to 3 years need 3 milligrams/day
Kids aged 4 to 8 years need 5 milligrams/day
Children aged 9 to 13 years need 8 milligrams/day
Teenage girls aged 14 to 18 years need 9 milligrams/day
Teenage boys aged 14 to 18 years require 11 milligrams/day
Signs of Zinc Deficiency
Because zinc is used in many areas of the body, deficiency can be a serious matter. Zinc deficiency can cause the following: ?

Delayed growth
Delayed sexual development
Impotence in men 
Hair loss
Diarrhea 
Sore skin and eyes 
Delayed wound healing
Weight loss 
Decreased appetite 
If you suspect you have a zinc deficiency, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before you start supplementing. Taking more zinc than you need through supplements can cause zinc toxicity. 

Zinc Toxicity
The signs of zinc toxicity are as follows: 

Nausea
Vomiting
Headaches
Little or no appetite
Diarrhea
Stomach cramps and indigestion

The upper limit dosage of zinc is 40 milligrams/day for adults. If you take more zinc than you should for a long period, you can have low copper levels, which can affect your nervous system. 

Zinc Interactions With Other Medications
Zinc can interact with other medications. Some medicines can lower the levels of zinc in your body. Taking zinc with other medications can make them less effective. 

Thiazide diuretics. Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide can make you lose zinc through urine. Taking these medicines for a long time can decrease the amount of zinc in your body.

Antibiotics. Taking quinolone or tetracycline with zinc can make the medication less effective and prevent your body from absorbing the zinc. Leave a gap of 4 to 6 hours between the medicine and zinc for best results. 

Penicillamine. Taking zinc with penicillamine, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, can lower the effectiveness of both. Take them 2 hours apart to maximize their benefits.

Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about any concerns regarding medicine interaction.

"Interested in cutting meat out of your diet, but not fish? Or are you considering going vegetarian but want some protein options beyond plants?

Consider the pescatarian diet. This plan â€” more like a lifestyle â€” is vegetarian with one key difference: You also eat fish and seafood. Registered dietitian Anthony DiMarino, RD, explains what it means to be pescatarian â€” and how to maximize the health benefits.

Foods you can eat on the pescatarian diet
There are no strict rules about how much of each food group you should eat on a pescatarian diet. Instead, you have the freedom and flexibility to choose which pescatarian-friendly foods you want to eat and how much, based on your preferences and health goals.

If you're a pescatarian, you choose to eat:

Dairy products.
Eggs.
Fish and seafood.
Fruits and vegetables.
Grains.
Legumes.
Nuts and seeds.
Foods you don't eat
Going pescatarian means you're choosing to avoid eating any type of meat that isn't seafood, including:

Poultry, such as chicken and turkey.
Red meat, including beef, pork and lamb.
Wild game, like venison and bison.
Health benefits of the pescatarian diet
Eliminating meat and poultry from your diet and focusing on plants and seafood can be a healthy switch. Benefits of a pescatarian diet can include:

1. Better heart health
One of the main benefits of going pescatarian is replacing less healthy meats with heart-healthy fish. Most Americans don't eat enough seafood, which contains high amounts of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA.

""EPA and DHA are called essential fatty acids because your body cannot make them,"" DiMarino says. ""Seafood is one of the best sources of these fats, which improve heart and blood vessel health. Omega-3s have been linked to lower risks of high blood pressure, blood clots and sudden cardiac death.""

Fruits and veggies also contain antioxidants, special compounds that lower your risk of getting heart disease. Adding these foods to a diet that's higher in fish provides a double dose of heart health benefits.

Another potential plus for your heart: Letting red meat go. Regularly eating red meat and pork increases your risk of heart disease. Red meat is also higher in calories and unhealthy fats than fish or plant-based foods.

""Eliminating red meat is a great way to boost your heart health,"" says DiMarino. ""Pescatarians can get all the nutrients they need without eating any beef, lamb or pork.""

2. Lower risk of cancer and other diseases
Fruits and vegetables are nutritional powerhouses, but most of us don't eat enough of them. Eating a colorful array of fruits and vegetables is an important part of an anti-cancer diet. These foods contain nutrients and phytochemicals that help fight the cell changes that can lead to cancer.

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, when you amp up your produce intake, you lower your risk of cancer in your:

Esophagus.
Head and neck.
Lungs.
Pancreas.
Prostate.
Stomach.
But an apple (plus other produce) a day can chase more than cancer away. Studies also show that a high intake of fruits and vegetables lowers your risk of Type 2 diabetes. ""Nearly everyone could benefit from adding more fruits and vegetables into their diet,"" notes DiMarino. ""These foods are the very best ones for fighting disease and living a healthier life overall.""

3. Good gut health
If your pescatarian plan includes lots of high-fiber foods, your gut is in for a treat. The fiber in plant foods helps prevent constipation and feeds your gut's microbiome. Your microbiome is home to bacteria, fungi and yeast that live in your small and large intestines.

""Your microbiome plays a key role in your immune system, digestion and metabolism,"" says DiMarino. ""A healthy microbiome can also boost your mental health.""

4. Calmer appetite
Many foods in the pescatarian diet, like legumes, nuts and seeds, can help you curb those afternoon cravings. These foods are naturally high in fiber and protein, which take longer to digest than simple carbs like chips and processed snack foods. The end result: You may eat fewer calories throughout the day and feel less hungry.

Protein is a building block for your body's tissues â€” every cell in your body needs it. And there's some evidence to suggest that eating enough protein could help you lose weight. But getting your protein from meats high in saturated fat, like hamburger, comes with health risks (plus extra calories).

Pescatarian proteins are the healthiest ones. Fish and eggs are great sources of lean protein. And plant-based proteins, like soy, nuts and legumes, are healthy ways to get more of this important nutrient, too.

""We all need protein, but not all protein sources are healthy,"" DiMarino states. ""If you go pescatarian, you eat the healthiest protein sources available. Choosing these lean proteins over high-fat meat could help support weight loss.""

But it's important to remember that going pescatarian doesn't automatically mean you'll cut calories, he adds. ""You must be choosy about your food choices. Focus on whole foods to help you feel fuller, longer.""

Potential pitfalls of going pescatarian
The pescatarian diet leaves your food choices largely up to you. But simply avoiding meat doesn't make for a healthy diet. To reap the benefits of a pescatarian lifestyle, avoid:

Too many processed foods
You can follow the pescatarian diet and still eat unhealthy foods. For example, potato chips and sugary cereals aren't meat, so you can ""technically"" eat them on this plan.

""Any diet can be unhealthy if you eat too many processed foods,"" cautions DiMarino. ""Processed foods tend to be higher in calories, unhealthy fats and sugar. They're also low in the vitamins and minerals your body needs.""

To make the most of the pescatarian plan, focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Eat processed foods sparingly â€” or not at all.

""You can avoid most processed foods by shopping the four walls of your grocery store,"" encourages DiMarino. ""Fill your cart with fresh produce, nuts and seeds, dairy, eggs and fish. Avoid the middle aisles, which typically contain foods like crackers, cookies and chips.""

Fish high in mercury or contaminants
For most people, the benefits of eating fish outweigh any risks. Most of the fish you eat should be the low-mercury types, which include:

Atlantic and Atka mackerel from Alaska (not king mackerel).
Canned light tuna (not albacore tuna).
Catfish.
Herring.
Pollock.
Salmon.
Shrimp and sardines.
But people who are pregnant or nursing should completely avoid high-mercury seafood. The highest-mercury types tend to be older, larger fish like:

Golden bass.
Golden snapper.
King mackerel.
Shark.
Swordfish.
""Most healthy adults should eat two servings of fish per week,"" DiMarino recommends. ""If you're not pregnant or nursing, you can eat high-mercury fish on occasion. But focus on the low-mercury types for most of your fish intake.""

Possible nutrient deficiencies
There aren't any guidelines for how much fish, eggs and dairy to eat on a pescatarian diet. If you don't eat these foods regularly, you could develop a deficiency in:

Calcium.
Iron.
Protein.
Vitamin B12.
Zinc.
""Pescatarians, like vegetarians, need to be mindful of nutrients that aren't readily available in many plant foods,"" says DiMarino. ""You can get enough zinc, protein and iron without eating a lot of eggs, dairy and fish, but it takes some planning.""

For example, many nuts, seeds and legumes are rich in zinc and protein. Fortified cereals and mushrooms contain vitamin B12. But you can't always find a nutrition label on fresh foods, so it's hard to know how much you're getting.

If you plan to eat smaller amounts of dairy, eggs and fish on the pescatarian diet, play it safe and talk with a registered dietitian. Together, you can come up with a meal plan that covers your nutritional needs.

Pescatarian vs. Mediterranean diet: Which is healthier?
The pescatarian lifestyle and the Mediterranean diet share some similarities. Both plans focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. But on the Mediterranean diet, you:

Eat meat: You can have any type of meat on the Mediterranean diet, but should minimize red and processed meats.
Emphasize olive oil: Both diets allow olive oil, but it's a key component of the Mediterranean diet.
Eat less dairy: The Mediterranean diet typically includes only a few servings of dairy each week.
""Following the Mediterranean diet is a proven way to lower your risk of heart disease,"" DiMarino says. ""But studies also show you can get similar results with the pescatarian diet. An important key with either diet is to choose whole foods over processed foods as much as possible.""

Choose what works for you
Following a pescatarian diet can improve your health â€” but it's not for everyone. ""Some people really enjoy lean chicken, or they don't like fish,"" notes DiMarino. ""In these cases, going pescatarian probably isn't a good idea. Consider the Mediterranean diet instead. The best diet for you is the most nutrient-filled one you can stick to long term.""";https://health.clevelandclinic.org/pescatarian-diet;interested cutting meat diet , fish ? considering going vegetarian want protein options beyond plants ? consider pescatarian diet . plan â€ ” like lifestyle â€ ” vegetarian one key difference : also eat fish seafood . registered dietitian anthony dimarino , rd , explains means pescatarian â€ ” maximize health benefits . foods eat pescatarian diet strict rules much food group eat pescatarian diet . instead , freedom flexibility choose pescatarian-friendly foods want eat much , based preferences health goals .

"It's not new news that processed and red meat are linked to bowel cancer. But in 2019, Cancer Research UK scientists took a closer look at how much meat might be enough to increase bowel cancer risk.

The study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, looked at whether people who eat an average of 76 grams of processed and red meat a day - approximately 3 slices of ham - are still at increased risk of bowel cancer. This is similar to the average amount people in the UK eat each day, and falls in a somewhat grey area within government guidelines - which state anyone who eats more than 90 grams a day should cut this to no more than 70 grams a day.

The main takeaway from the study was that even moderate meat-eating increases bowel cancer risk. So, what does this mean for a nation famed for its fry ups?

What are 'red' and 'processed' meat?
First, let's clear up some definitions.

'Red' meat is (as you might expect), any meat that's a dark red colour before it's cooked - this obviously means meats like beef and lamb, but also includes pork.

'Processed' meat is meat that's not sold fresh, but instead has been cured, salted, smoked, or otherwise preserved in some way (so things like bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, salami, and pepperoni). But this doesn't include fresh burgers or mince.

Both of these types of meat are distinct from 'white' meats, like fresh chicken or turkey, and fish (neither of which appear to increase your risk of cancer).

How do we know processed and red meat cause cancer?
The evidence linking processed and red meat to cancer has been stacking up for over a decade. And in 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - a group of experts that review and report on research evidence - classified processed meat as a 'definite' cause of cancer (or Group 1 carcinogen) - the same group that includes smoking and alcohol. And red meat is a 'probable' cause of cancer (or a Group 2a carcinogen) - the same group as night shift work.

While this may sound alarming, it's important to remember that these groups show how confident IARC is that red and processed meat cause cancer, not how many cancer cases they cause, as we wrote when we covered a previous IARC decision on diesel emissions, and interviewed one of our experts in the causes of cancer.

As Professor David Phillips - a Cancer Research UK-funded carcinogen expert from King's College London - explains, ""IARC does 'hazard identification', not 'risk assessment'.

""That sounds quite technical, but what it means is that IARC isn't in the business of telling us how potent something is in causing cancer - only whether it does so or not"", he says.

To take an analogy, think of banana skins. They definitely can cause accidents, explains Phillips, but in practice this doesn't happen very often (unless you work in a banana factory). And the sort of harm you can come to from slipping on a banana skin isn't generally as severe as, say, being in a car accident.

But under a hazard identification system like IARC's, 'banana skins' and 'cars' would come under the same category - they both definitely do cause accidents.

To put things in perspective, let's look at how processed meat stacks up against smoking.
How does processed and red meat cause cancer?
So far, research has linked 3 chemicals to increased bowel cancer risk. These chemicals are either naturally found in meat, added during processing or produced when cooking:

haem (a red pigment found mostly in red meat);
nitrates and nitrites (used to keep processed meat fresher for longer); and
heterocyclic amines and polycyclic amines (produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures)
All 3 can damage the cells in our bowel, and it's the accumulation of this damage over time that increases cancer risk.

How much matters?
The latest study analysed data from half a million UK adults over almost 7 years and found that moderate processed and red meat eaters - those eating 79g per day on average - had a 32% increased risk of bowel cancer compared to people eating less than 11g of red and processed meat daily.

To put this in context, for every 10,000 people on the study who ate less than 11 grams of red and processed meat a day, 45 were diagnosed with bowel cancer. Eating 79 grams of red and processed meat a day caused 14 extra cases of bowel cancer per 10,000 people. These figures are just for the independent effect of meat consumption, as they take into account other differences between these groups of people, for example sex, deprivation, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, other aspects of diet, reproductive factors, and body mass index.

Professor Tim Key, who co-led the recent study and is deputy director at the University of Oxford's cancer epidemiology unit, says that while the impact of cutting back on processed meat might be smaller than quitting smoking, it's still important.

""Everyone eats and everyone is at risk of colorectal cancer,"" he says. ""So any increase in risk makes a difference when we look at the whole population.""

And he sees the results as a reminder for those following government guidelines.

""Current government guidelines suggest if you eat more than 90 grams a day on average you should cut down to 70 grams a day. Our results suggest cutting down a bit more gives slightly lower risk, and are a reminder that there is still an increase in risk for modest intakes of meat.""

Top tips for cutting down
Pay attention to your portions - try having 1 sausage instead of 2 or switching half of the meat in your usual dishes for beans or veggies.
Have meat free days - pick a day (or days) to have no meat at all.
Get out of a recipe rut - look for new recipes that use fresh chicken or fish instead of processed and red meat.
What if I have my bacon sandwich on wholemeal bread?
Having a diet high in fibre, especially wholegrains, found in foods like wholemeal bread or brown rice, and doing lots of physical activity can is associated with lower risk of bowel cancer - so could this mitigate cell damage from eating processed and red meat?

Both fibre and lots of physical activity help us to poo more often, reducing the amount of time harmful chemicals, including those in processed and red meat, spend in the gut. But so far it's not clear how much difference this could make to the amount of damage in our cells.

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as balancing out something that increases risk with something that reduces it. Studies take in to account other things that might impact risk, so good studies that show the link between processed and red meat and bowel cancer will note fibre intake and many other factors which can be associated with both cancer risk and meat intake.

What does this mean for me?
The evidence is clear that eating less processed and red meat can help reduce the risk of bowel cancer, the 4th most common cancer in the UK.

Eating less can make a difference, but it's important to think about doing this as part of a healthy diet overall, along with being active.

""The most important diet related risk factors for cancer are obesity and alcohol, which both increase risk of many types of cancer, and cause more cases than red and processed meat,"" says Key.

And he notes that diet has other health impacts beyond bowel cancer risk.

""For example, meat can be an important source of iron so if someone is thinking about giving up meat all together they need to think about other sources of this,"" he says.

"Exciting new evidence continues to point to the effectiveness of a plant-based dietary approach for blood sugar control and for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. As the science becomes more robust, more organizations are recognizing and supporting this way of eating.

In their 2018 guidelines, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology encouraged their clinicians to recommend a primarily plant-based diet-rich in healthful carbohydrates and low in saturated fats-to their patients with type 2 diabetes.[1]

The American Diabetes Association's 2018 Standards of Care also recognized this dietary approach as an effective way to treat type 2 diabetes. And more recently, the American Heart Association stated in their 2021 Dietary Guidance to Improve Cardiovascular Health that the majority of our proteins should be plant-based (people with type 2 diabetes face a 3-5x greater risk of heart disease).[2] 

Here's the latest research on how a plant-based diet can help type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, how quickly you can expect to see changes in your blood sugar after adopting this dietary approach, and what to do if you experience spikes in your sugar levels as you transition to this new way of eating.

A plant-based diet for type 2 diabetes 
Can a plant-based diet improve type 2 diabetes? Countless studies consistently show a link between the intake of plant-based diets and improvements in the course of type 2 diabetes. 

One of the most comprehensive studies published to date found solid evidence that adhering to a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. In the systematic review and meta-analysis, researchers examined nine studies that included over 300,000 participants with around 23,000 cases of type 2 diabetes. Those who adhered to a predominantly plant-based diet had a 35% lower risk of type 2 diabetes than those with less adherence.

Why do plant-based diets work so well? According to the researchers, healthy plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds have been shown to improve insulin resistance, blood pressure, weight, and inflammation - all factors that may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.

Many other studies demonstrate that plant-based diets not only prevent type 2 diabetes but also can treat and reduce the outcomes associated with type 2 diabetes. In 2016, the Canadian Diabetes Association released a comprehensive review of the literature regarding plant-based diets for the treatment of diabetes. They concluded that plant-based diets are ""just as effective, if not more effective than other diabetes diets in improving body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, insulin sensitivity, glycated hemoglobin levels, oxidative stress markers, and renovascular markersďż˝and plant-based diets reduced the need for diabetes medications.""[3]

This 2019 review also found strong evidence from the meta-analysis of randomized control trials indicating that plant-based diets improve glycemic control by lowering A1c in people with type 2 diabetes. 

A plant-based diet for insulin resistance
Evidence points to the effectiveness of plant-based diets in combatting type 2 diabetes because they target insulin resistance - the root cause of type 2 diabetes. 

In a large 2018 cohort study, researchers found that a diet higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based ones was associated with lower insulin resistance and a lower risk of pre- and type 2 diabetes.[4] The authors concluded that a plant-based diet plays a protective role in the development of type 2 diabetes compared to a more animal-based one.

Furthermore, in this randomized control trial, participants were asked to follow a low-fat plant-based diet or to make no changes to their diet for 16 weeks. Participants who followed the low-fat plant-based diet had significantly improved insulin resistance and beta-cell (pancreatic) function.

On the other hand, a study conducted by Azemati and colleagues in 2017 aimed to determine the association between protein intake and its link to insulin resistance. Their results showed that the long-term effects of a higher total protein and higher animal protein were both associated with increased insulin resistance.

To further expand on this point, a 2015 meta-analysis examined the meat intake of over 50,000 people. They found that the consumption of meat was associated with higher fasting glucose levels? and? higher fasting insulin concentration.[5] One explanation for this outcome is due to red meat's high content of saturated fat. When examining saturated fat specifically, its high intake may also increase one's risk of developing type 2 diabetes.[6] 

I'm eating a plant-based or vegan diet but experiencing high blood sugar
It's not uncommon to experience blood sugar spikes after first adopting a plant-based diet. To grasp this phenomenon, it is important to understand the normal metabolism of carbohydrates. 

Glucose normally fluctuates throughout the day, particularly after meals. When we consume carbohydrates, our body breaks them down and converts them into glucose. When glucose enters our bloodstream, the pancreas receives a signal to release a hormone called insulin. As you can see below, insulin acts as a ""key,"" allowing glucose to funnel out of the bloodstream and into our cells. As this process continues, blood glucose levels drop back down.

Research demonstrates that insulin resistance develops from a continuous surplus of calories (aka energy) entering the body. Evolutionarily, our bodies were not programmed to waste energy so any food we consume is either used right away or stored as fat for later use. Our bodies, though, contain a finite number of adipose (fat cells), and there is a limit as to how much fat they can hold. Thus, as our cells store more and more fat, they begin to reach their capacity, causing them to swell up and produce an inflammatory response. This response shuts off the insulin receptors on the cells. As more insulin receptors shut off, less glucose can enter the cell leaving an individual with high blood sugar.

As insulin resistance worsens, so does our body's ability to use and metabolize carbohydrates properly. Glucose spikes after a meal indicate you likely have poor carbohydrate tolerance due to insulin resistance.

For this reason, when you eat a healthy carbohydrate, like an apple, you may experience a glucose spike. A slow transition away from a diet high in animal food sources (and processed foods!) is one of the best ways to reverse insulin resistance and improve your carbohydrate tolerance.

How long does it take a vegan or plant-based diet to lower blood sugar?

It can take two weeks up to a few months to see lower blood sugar after adopting a vegan or plant-based diet. Because many studies focus on long-term results, we don't have a lot of research measuring the short-term effects of a plant-based diet on blood sugar levels. 

In a trial of a low-fat vegan diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes, participants experienced a 28% reduction in their glucose levels (195 to 141 mg/dl) after 12 weeks.[7] In this 2016 study, participants who adhered to a low-fat, plant-based diet saw an average drop of 21 points in their fasting blood glucose in as few as four weeks. And although these are just case studies, participants who adhere strictly to the Reversing T2D's low saturated fat, plant-based diet see improvements in their glucose levels in as few as two weeks. 

Ultimately, changes in your blood sugar are determined by two main factors, (1) your level of insulin resistance, (2) and how aggressive you are with your dietary and lifestyle changes. For example, if you have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes (which indicates a lower level of insulin resistance) and adhere to a strictly plant-based diet and incorporate exercise, there is a good chance you'll see quicker improvements in your blood sugar. 

To recap the evidence behind plant-based diets and blood sugar:
Countless studies consistently show a link between the adoption of a plant-based diet and improvements in the course of type 2 diabetes. 
Plant-based proteins work by preventing and reversing insulin resistance while animal-based ones contribute to its development.
You may experience blood sugar spikes after starting a vegan or plant-based diet because of your insulin resistance and poor carbohydrate tolerance. Perseverance is important during this stage; continue a plant-based diet and you will see improvements. 
It can take anywhere from two weeks to a few months to see reductions in your blood sugar after starting a vegan or plant-based diet.";https://type2diabetesrevolution.com/effects-plant-based-diets-blood-sugar-type-2-diabetes/;"exciting new evidence continues point effectiveness plant-based dietary approach blood sugar control prevention treatment type 2 diabetes . science becomes robust , organizations recognizing supporting way eating . 2018 guidelines , american association clinical endocrinology encouraged clinicians recommend primarily plant-based diet-rich healthful carbohydrates low saturated fats-to patients type 2 diabetes .

"Research Highlights:

Eating a plant-centered diet during young adulthood is associated with a lower risk of heart disease in middle age, according to a long-term study with about 30 years of follow-up.
A separate study with about 15 years of follow-up found that eating more plant-based foods that have been shown to lower cholesterol, called the ""Portfolio Diet"", is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women.

DALLAS, Aug. 4, 2021 - Eating more nutritious, plant-based foods is heart-healthy at any age, according to two research studies published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access journal of the American Heart Association.

In two separate studies analyzing different measures of healthy plant food consumption, researchers found that both young adults and postmenopausal women had fewer heart attacks and were less likely to develop cardiovascular disease when they ate more healthy plant foods.

The American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations suggest an overall healthy dietary pattern that emphasizes a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, skinless poultry and fish, nuts and legumes and non-tropical vegetable oils. It also advises limited consumption of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, red meat, sweets and sugary drinks.

One study, titled ""A Plant-Centered Diet and Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease during Young to Middle Adulthood,"" evaluated whether long-term consumption of a plant-centered diet and a shift toward a plant-centered diet starting in young adulthood are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in midlife.

""Earlier research was focused on single nutrients or single foods, yet there is little data about a plant-centered diet and the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease,"" said Yuni Choi, Ph.D., lead author of the young adult study and a postdoctoral researcher in the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis.

Choi and colleagues examined diet and the occurrence of heart disease in 4,946 adults enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants were 18- to 30-years-old at the time of enrollment (1985-1986) in this study and were free of cardiovascular disease at that time. Participants included 2,509 Black adults and 2,437 white adults (54.9% women overall) who were also analyzed by education level (equivalent to more than high school vs. high school or less). Participants had eight follow-up exams from 1987-88 to 2015-16 that included lab tests, physical measurements, medical histories and assessment of lifestyle factors. Unlike randomized controlled trials, participants were not instructed to eat certain things and were not told their scores on the diet measures, so the researchers could collect unbiased, long-term habitual diet data.

After detailed diet history interviews, the quality of the participants diets was scored based on the A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS) composed of 46 food groups at years 0, 7 and 20 of the study. The food groups were classified into beneficial foods (such as fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and whole grains); adverse foods (such as fried potatoes, high-fat red meat, salty snacks, pastries and soft drinks); and neutral foods (such as potatoes, refined grains, lean meats and shellfish) based on their known association with cardiovascular disease.

Participants who received higher scores ate a variety of beneficial foods, while people who had lower scores ate more adverse foods. Overall, higher values correspond to a nutritionally rich, plant-centered diet.

""As opposed to existing diet quality scores that are usually based on small numbers of food groups, APDQS is explicit in capturing the overall quality of diet using 46 individual food groups, describing the whole diet that the general population commonly consumes. Our scoring is very comprehensive, and it has many similarities with diets like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans Healthy Eating Index (from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service), the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet,"" said David E. Jacobs Jr., Ph.D., senior author of the study and Mayo Professor of Public Health in the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis.

Researchers found:

During 32 years of follow-up, 289 of the participants developed cardiovascular disease (including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, heart-related chest pain or clogged arteries anywhere in the body).
People who scored in the top 20% on the long-term diet quality score (meaning they ate the most nutritionally rich plant foods and fewer adversely rated animal products) were 52% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease, after considering several factors  (including age, sex, race, average caloric consumption, education, parental history of heart disease, smoking and average physical activity).
In addition, between year 7 and 20 of the study when participants ages ranged from 25 to 50, those who improved their diet quality the most (eating more beneficial plant foods and fewer adversely rated animal products) were 61% less likely to develop subsequent cardiovascular disease, in comparison to the participants whose diet quality declined the most during that time.
There were few vegetarians among the participants, so the study was not able to assess the possible benefits of a strict vegetarian diet, which excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy and eggs.
""A nutritionally rich, plant-centered diet is beneficial for cardiovascular health. A plant-centered diet is not necessarily vegetarian,"" Choi said. ""People can choose among plant foods that are as close to natural as possible, not highly processed. We think that individuals can include animal products in moderation from time to time, such as non-fried poultry, non-fried fish, eggs and low-fat dairy.""

Because this study is observational, it cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between diet and heart disease.

In another study, ""Relationship Between a Plant-Based Dietary Portfolio and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Prospective Cohort Study,"" researchers, in collaboration with WHI investigators led by Simin Liu, M.D., Ph.D., at Brown University, evaluated whether or not diets that included a dietary portfolio of plant-based foods with U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved health claims for lowering ""bad"" cholesterol levels (known as the ""Portfolio Diet"") were associated with fewer cardiovascular disease events in a large group of postmenopausal women.

The ""Portfolio Diet"" includes nuts; plant protein from soy, beans or tofu; viscous soluble fiber from oats, barley, okra, eggplant, oranges, apples and berries; plant sterols from enriched foods and monounsaturated fats found in olive and canola oil and avocadoes; along with limited consumption of saturated fats and dietary cholesterol. Previously, two randomized trials demonstrated that reaching high target levels of foods included in the Portfolio Diet resulted in significant lowering of ""bad"" cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), more so than a traditional low-saturated-fat National Cholesterol and Education Program diet in one study and on par with taking a cholesterol-lowering statin medication in another.

The study analyzed whether postmenopausal women who followed the Portfolio Diet experienced fewer heart disease events. The study included 123,330 women in the U.S.  who participated in the Women's Health Initiative, a long-term national study looking at risk factors, prevention and early detection of serious health conditions in postmenopausal women. When the women in this analysis enrolled in the study between 1993 and 1998, they were between 50-79 years old (average age of 62) and did not have cardiovascular disease. The study group was followed until 2017 (average follow-up time of 15.3 years). Researchers used self-reported food-frequency questionnaires data to score each woman on adherence to the Portfolio Diet.

The researchers found:

Compared to women who followed the Portfolio Diet less frequently, those with the closest alignment were 11% less likely to develop any type of cardiovascular disease, 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease and 17% less likely to develop heart failure.
There was no association between following the Portfolio Diet more closely and the occurrence of stroke or atrial fibrillation.
""These results present an important opportunity, as there is still room for people to incorporate more cholesterol-lowering plant foods into their diets. With even greater adherence to the Portfolio dietary pattern, one would expect an association with even less cardiovascular events, perhaps as much as cholesterol-lowering medications. Still, an 11% reduction is clinically meaningful and would meet anyone's minimum threshold for a benefit. The results indicate the Portfolio Diet yields heart-health benefits,"" said John Sievenpiper, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study at St. Michael's Hospital, a site of Unity Health Toronto in Ontario, Canada, and associate professor of nutritional sciences and medicine at the University of Toronto.

The researchers believe the results highlight possible opportunities to lower heart disease by encouraging people to consume more foods in the Portfolio Diet.

""We also found a dose response in our study, meaning that you can start small, adding one component of the Portfolio Diet at a time, and gain more heart-health benefits as you add more components,"" said Andrea J. Glenn, M.Sc., R.D., lead author of the study and a doctoral student at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and in nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.

Although the study was observational and cannot directly establish a cause-and-effect relation between diet and cardiovascular events, researchers feel it provides a most reliable estimate for the diet-heart relation to-date due to its study design (included well-validated food frequency questionnaires administered at baseline and year three in a large population of highly dedicated participants). Nevertheless, the investigators report that these findings need to be further investigated in additional populations of men or younger women.
